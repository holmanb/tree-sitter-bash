1. Shell Command Language

This chapter contains the definition of the Shell Command Language.
1.1 Shell Introduction

The shell is a command language interpreter. This chapter describes the syntax of that command language as it is used by the sh utility and the system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024.

The shell operates according to the following general overview of operations. The specific details are included in the cited sections of this chapter.

        The shell reads its input from a file (see sh), from the -c option or from the system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024. If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the characters "#!", the results are unspecified.

        The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators; see 2.3 Token Recognition.

        The shell parses the input into simple commands (see 2.9.1 Simple Commands) and compound commands (see 2.9.4 Compound Commands).

        For each word within a command, the shell processes -escape sequences inside dollar-single-quotes (see 2.2.4 Dollar-Single-Quotes) and then performs various word expansions (see 2.6 Word Expansions). In the case of a simple command, the results usually include a list of pathnames and fields to be treated as a command name and arguments; see 2.9 Shell Commands.

        The shell performs redirection (see 2.7 Redirection) and removes redirection operators and their operands from the parameter list.

        The shell executes a function (see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command), built-in (see 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities), executable file, or script, giving the names of the arguments as positional parameters numbered 1 to n, and the name of the command (or in the case of a function within a script, the name of the script) as special parameter 0 (see 2.9.1.4 Command Search and Execution).

        The shell optionally waits for the command to complete and collects the exit status (see 2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands).

1.2 Quoting

Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to preserve the literal meaning of the special characters in the next paragraph, prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and prevent parameter expansion and command substitution within here-document processing (see 2.7.4 Here-Document ).

The application shall quote the following characters if they are to represent themselves:

|  &  ;    (  )  $  `  \  "  '      

and the following might need to be quoted under certain circumstances. That is, these characters are sometimes special depending on conditions described elsewhere in this volume of POSIX.1-2024:

*  ?  [  ]  ^  -  !  #  ~  =  %  {  ,  }

Note:
        A future version of this standard may extend the conditions under which these characters are special. Therefore applications should quote them whenever they are intended to represent themselves. This does not apply to  ('-') since it is in the portable filename character set.

The various quoting mechanisms are the escape character, single-quotes, double-quotes, and dollar-single-quotes. The here-document represents another form of quoting; see 2.7.4 Here-Document.
1.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash)

A  that is not quoted shall preserve the literal value of the following character, with the exception of a . If a  immediately follows the , the shell shall interpret this as line continuation. The  and  shall be removed before splitting the input into tokens. Since the escaped  is removed entirely from the input and is not replaced by any white space, it cannot serve as a token separator.
1.2.2 Single-Quotes

Enclosing characters in single-quotes ('') shall preserve the literal value of each character within the single-quotes. A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes.
1.2.3 Double-Quotes

Enclosing characters in double-quotes ("") shall preserve the literal value of all characters within the double-quotes, with the exception of the characters backquote, , and , as follows:

$
        The  shall retain its special meaning introducing parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion), a form of command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution), and arithmetic expansion (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion), but shall not retain its special meaning introducing the dollar-single-quotes form of quoting (see 2.2.4 Dollar-Single-Quotes).

        The input characters within the quoted string that are also enclosed between "$(" and the matching ')' shall not be affected by the double-quotes, but rather shall define the command(s) whose output replaces the "$(...)" when the word is expanded. The tokenizing rules in 2.3 Token Recognition shall be applied recursively to find the matching ')'.

        For the four varieties of parameter expansion that provide for substring processing (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion), within the string of characters from an enclosed "${" to the matching '}', the double-quotes within which the expansion occurs shall have no effect on the handling of any special characters.

        For parameter expansions other than the four varieties that provide for substring processing, within the string of characters from an enclosed "${" to the matching '}', the double-quotes within which the expansion occurs shall preserve the literal value of all characters, with the exception of the characters double-quote, backquote, , and . If any unescaped double-quote characters occur within the string, other than in embedded command substitutions, the behavior is unspecified. The backquote and  characters shall follow the same rules as for characters in double-quotes described in this section. The  character shall follow the same rules as for characters in double-quotes described in this section except that it shall additionally retain its special meaning as an escape character when followed by '}' and this shall prevent the escaped '}' from being considered when determining the matching '}' (using the rule in 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion).
`
        The backquote shall retain its special meaning introducing the other form of command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution). The portion of the quoted string from the initial backquote and the characters up to the next backquote that is not preceded by a , having escape characters removed, defines that command whose output replaces "`...`" when the word is expanded. Either of the following cases produces undefined results:

            A quoted (single-quoted, double-quoted, or dollar-single-quoted) string that begins, but does not end, within the "`...`" sequence

            A "`...`" sequence that begins, but does not end, within the same double-quoted string

\
        Outside of "$(...)" and "${...}" the  shall retain its special meaning as an escape character (see 2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash)) only when immediately followed by one of the following characters:

        $   `   \   

*r by a double-quote character that would otherwise be considered special (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion and 2.7.4 Here-Document).

When double-quotes are used to quote a parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion, the literal value of all characters within the result of the expansion shall be preserved.

The application shall ensure that a double-quote that is not within "$(...)" nor within "${...}" is immediately preceded by a  in order to be included within double-quotes. The parameter '@' has special meaning inside double-quotes and is described in 2.5.2 Special Parameters.
1.2.4 Dollar-Single-Quotes

A sequence of characters starting with a  immediately followed by a single-quote ($') shall preserve the literal value of all characters up to an unescaped terminating single-quote ('), with the exception of certain -escape sequences, as follows:

        \" yields a  (double-quote) character, but note that  can be included unescaped.

        \' yields an  (single-quote) character.

        \\ yields a  character.

        \a yields an  character.

        \b yields a  character.

        \e yields an  character.

        \f yields a  character.

        \n yields a  character.

        \r yields a  character.

        \t yields a  character.

        \v yields a  character.

        \cX yields the control character listed in the Value column of Values for cpio c_mode Field in the OPERANDS section of the stty utility when X is one of the characters listed in the ^c column of the same table, except that \c\\ yields the  control character since the  character has to be escaped.

        \xXX yields the byte whose value is the hexadecimal value XX (one or more hexadecimal digits). If more than two hexadecimal digits follow \x, the results are unspecified.

        \ddd yields the byte whose value is the octal value ddd (one to three octal digits).

        The behavior of an unescaped  immediately followed by any other character, including , is unspecified.

In cases where a variable number of characters can be used to specify an escape sequence (\xXX and \ddd), the escape sequence shall be terminated by the first character that is not of the expected type or, for \ddd sequences, when the maximum number of characters specified has been found, whichever occurs first.

These -escape sequences shall be processed (replaced with the bytes or characters they yield) immediately prior to word expansion (see 2.6 Word Expansions) of the word in which the dollar-single-quotes sequence occurs.

If a \xXX or \ddd escape sequence yields a byte whose value is 0, it is unspecified whether that null byte is included in the result or if that byte and any following regular characters and escape sequences up to the terminating unescaped single-quote are evaluated and discarded.

If the octal value specified by \ddd will not fit in a byte, the results are unspecified.

If a \e or \cX escape sequence specifies a character that does not have an encoding in the locale in effect when these -escape sequences are processed, the result is implementation-defined. However, implementations shall not replace an unsupported character with bytes that do not form valid characters in that locale's character set.

If a -escape sequence represents a single-quote character (for example \'), that sequence shall not terminate the dollar-single-quote sequence.
1.3 Token Recognition

The shell shall read its input in terms of lines. (For details about how the shell reads its input, see the description of sh.) The input lines can be of unlimited length. These lines shall be parsed using two major modes: ordinary token recognition and processing of here-documents.

When an io_here token has been recognized by the grammar (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), one or more of the subsequent lines immediately following the next NEWLINE token form the body of a here-document and shall be parsed according to the rules of 2.7.4 Here-Document. Any non-NEWLINE tokens (including more io_here tokens) that are recognized while searching for the next NEWLINE token shall be saved for processing after the here-document has been parsed. If a saved token is an io_here token, the corresponding here-document shall start on the line immediately following the line containing the trailing delimiter of the previous here-document. If any saved token includes a  character, the behavior is unspecified.

When it is not processing an io_here, the shell shall break its input into tokens by applying the first applicable rule below to each character in turn in its input. At the start of input or after a previous token has just been delimited, the first or next token, respectively, shall start with the first character that has not already been included in a token and is not discarded according to the rules below. Once a token has started, zero or more characters from the input shall be appended to the token until the end of the token is delimited according to one of the rules below. When both the start and end of a token have been delimited, the characters forming the token shall be exactly those in the input between the two delimiters, including any quoting characters. If a rule below indicates that a token is delimited, and no characters have been included in the token, that empty token shall be discarded.

        If the end of input is recognized, the current token (if any) shall be delimited.

        If the previous character was used as part of an operator and the current character is not quoted and can be used with the previous characters to form an operator, it shall be used as part of that (operator) token.

        If the previous character was used as part of an operator and the current character cannot be used with the previous characters to form an operator, the operator containing the previous character shall be delimited.

        If the current character is an unquoted , single-quote, or double-quote or is the first character of an unquoted  single-quote sequence, it shall affect quoting for subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted text. The rules for quoting are as described in 2.2 Quoting. During token recognition no substitutions shall be actually performed, and the result token shall contain exactly the characters that appear in the input unmodified, including any embedded or enclosing quotes or substitution operators, between the start and the end of the quoted text. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the quoted field.

        If the current character is an unquoted '$' or '`', the shell shall identify the start of any candidates for parameter expansion ( 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion), command substitution ( 2.6.3 Command Substitution), or arithmetic expansion ( 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion) from their introductory unquoted character sequences: '$' or "${", "$(" or '`', and "$((", respectively. The shell shall read sufficient input to determine the end of the unit to be expanded (as explained in the cited sections). While processing the characters, if instances of expansions or quoting are found nested within the substitution, the shell shall recursively process them in the manner specified for the construct that is found. For "$(" and '`' only, if instances of io_here tokens are found nested within the substitution, they shall be parsed according to the rules of 2.7.4 Here-Document; if the terminating ')' or '`' of the substitution occurs before the NEWLINE token marking the start of the here-document, the behavior is unspecified. The characters found from the beginning of the substitution to its end, allowing for any recursion necessary to recognize embedded constructs, shall be included unmodified in the result token, including any embedded or enclosing substitution operators or quotes. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the substitution.

        If the current character is not quoted and can be used as the first character of a new operator, the current token (if any) shall be delimited. The current character shall be used as the beginning of the next (operator) token.

        If the current character is an unquoted , any token containing the previous character is delimited and the current character shall be discarded.

        If the previous character was part of a word, the current character shall be appended to that word.

        If the current character is a '#', it and all subsequent characters up to, but excluding, the next  shall be discarded as a comment. The  that ends the line is not considered part of the comment.

        The current character is used as the start of a new word.

Once a token is delimited, it is categorized as required by the grammar in 2.10 Shell Grammar.

In situations where the shell parses its input as a program, once a complete_command has been recognized by the grammar (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), the complete_command shall be executed before the next complete_command is tokenized and parsed.
1.3.1 Alias Substitution

After a token has been categorized as type TOKEN (see 2.10.1 Shell Grammar Lexical Conventions), including (recursively) any token resulting from an alias substitution, the TOKEN shall be subject to alias substitution if all of the following conditions are true:

        The TOKEN does not contain any quoting characters.

        The TOKEN is a valid alias name (see XBD 3.10 Alias Name).

        An alias with that name is in effect.

        The TOKEN did not either fully or, optionally, partially result from an alias substitution of the same alias name at any earlier recursion level.

        Either the TOKEN is being considered for alias substitution because it follows an alias substitution whose replacement value ended with a  (see below) or the TOKEN could be parsed as the command name word of a simple command (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), based on this TOKEN and the tokens (if any) that preceded it, but ignoring whether any subsequent characters would allow that.

except that if the TOKEN meets the above conditions and would be recognized as a reserved word (see 2.4 Reserved Words) if it occurred in an appropriate place in the input, it is unspecified whether the TOKEN is subject to alias substitution.

When a TOKEN is subject to alias substitution, the value of the alias shall be processed as if it had been read from the input instead of the TOKEN, with token recognition (see 2.3 Token Recognition) resuming at the start of the alias value. When the end of the alias value is reached, the shell may behave as if an additional  character had been read from the input after the TOKEN that was replaced. If it does not add this , it is unspecified whether the current token is delimited before token recognition is applied to the character (if any) that followed the TOKEN in the input.

Note:
        A future version of this standard may disallow adding this .

If the value of the alias replacing the TOKEN ends in a  that would be unquoted after substitution, and optionally if it ends in a  that would be quoted after substitution, the shell shall check the next token in the input, if it is a TOKEN, for alias substitution; this process shall continue until a TOKEN is found that is not a valid alias or an alias value does not end in such a .

An implementation may defer the effect of a change to an alias but the change shall take effect no later than the completion of the currently executing complete_command (see 2.10 Shell Grammar). Changes to aliases shall not take effect out of order. Implementations may provide predefined aliases that are in effect when the shell is invoked.

When used as specified by this volume of POSIX.1-2024, alias definitions shall not be inherited by separate invocations of the shell or by the utility execution environments invoked by the shell; see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment .
1.4 Reserved Words

Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell; see 2.9 Shell Commands. The following words shall be recognized as reserved words:

!
{
}
case
	

do
done
elif
else
	

esac
fi
for
if
	

in
then
until
while

This recognition shall only occur when none of the characters is quoted and when the word is used as:

        The first word of a command
        The first word following one of the reserved words other than case, for, or in
        The third word in a case command (only in is valid in this case)
        The third word in a for command (only in and do are valid in this case)

See the grammar in 2.10 Shell Grammar.

When used in circumstances where reserved words are recognized (described above), the following words may be recognized as reserved words, in which case the results are unspecified except as described below for time:

[[
	

]]
	

function
	

namespace
	

select
	

time

When the word time is recognized as a reserved word in circumstances where it would, if it were not a reserved word, be the command name (see 2.9.1.1 Order of Processing) of a simple command that would execute the time utility in a manner other than one for which time states that the results are unspecified, the behavior shall be as specified for the time utility.

When used in circumstances where reserved words are recognized (described above), all words whose final character is a  (':') are reserved; their use in those circumstances produces unspecified results.
1.5 Parameters and Variables

A parameter can be denoted by a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed in 2.5.2 Special Parameters. A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.

A parameter is set if it has an assigned value (null is a valid value). Once a variable is set, it can only be unset by using the unset special built-in command.

Parameters can contain arbitrary byte sequences, except for the null byte. The shell shall process their values as characters only when performing operations that are described in this standard in terms of characters.
1.5.1 Positional Parameters

A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by a decimal representation of a positive integer. The digits denoting the positional parameters shall always be interpreted as a decimal value, even if there is a leading zero. When a positional parameter with more than one digit is specified, the application shall enclose the digits in braces (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion).

Examples:

        "$8", "${8}", "${08}", "${008}", etc. all expand to the value of the eighth positional parameter.
        "${10}" expands to the value of the tenth positional parameter.
        "$10" expands to the value of the first positional parameter followed by the character '0'.

Note:
        0 is a special parameter, not a positional parameter, and therefore the results of expanding ${00} are unspecified.

Positional parameters are initially assigned when the shell is invoked (see sh), temporarily replaced when a shell function is invoked (see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command), and can be reassigned with the set special built-in command.
1.5.2 Special Parameters

Listed below are the special parameters and the values to which they shall expand. Only the values of the special parameters are listed; see 2.6 Word Expansions for a detailed summary of all the stages involved in expanding words.

@
        Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one, initially producing one field for each positional parameter that is set. When the expansion occurs in a context where field splitting will be performed, any empty fields may be discarded and each of the non-empty fields shall be further split as described in 2.6.5 Field Splitting. When the expansion occurs within double-quotes, the behavior is unspecified unless one of the following is true:

            Field splitting as described in 2.6.5 Field Splitting would be performed if the expansion were not within double-quotes (regardless of whether field splitting would have any effect; for example, if IFS is null).
            The double-quotes are within the word of a ${parameter:-word} or a ${parameter:+word} expansion (with or without the ; see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion) which would have been subject to field splitting if parameter had been expanded instead of word.

        If one of these conditions is true, the initial fields shall be retained as separate fields, except that if the parameter being expanded was embedded within a word, the first field shall be joined with the beginning part of the original word and the last field shall be joined with the end part of the original word. In all other contexts the results of the expansion are unspecified. If there are no positional parameters, the expansion of '@' shall generate zero fields, even when '@' is within double-quotes; however, if the expansion is embedded within a word which contains one or more other parts that expand to a quoted null string, these null string(s) shall still produce an empty field, except that if the other parts are all within the same double-quotes as the '@', it is unspecified whether the result is zero fields or one empty field.
*
        Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one, initially producing one field for each positional parameter that is set. When the expansion occurs in a context where field splitting will be performed, any empty fields may be discarded and each of the non-empty fields shall be further split as described in 2.6.5 Field Splitting. When the expansion occurs in a context where field splitting will not be performed, the initial fields shall be joined to form a single field with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS variable if IFS contains at least one character, or separated by a  if IFS is unset, or with no separation if IFS is set to a null string.
#
        Expands to the shortest representation of the decimal number of positional parameters. The command name (parameter 0) shall not be counted in the number given by '#' because it is a special parameter, not a positional parameter.
?
        Expands to the shortest representation of the decimal exit status (see 2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands) of the pipeline (see 2.9.2 Pipelines) executed from the current shell execution environment (not a subshell environment) that most recently either terminated or, optionally but only if the shell is interactive and job control is enabled, was stopped by a signal. If this pipeline terminated, the status value shall be its exit status; otherwise, the status value shall be the same as the exit status that would have resulted if the pipeline had been terminated by a signal with the same number as the signal that stopped it. The value of the special parameter '?' shall be set to 0 during initialization of the shell. When a subshell environment is created, the value of the special parameter '?' from the invoking shell environment shall be preserved in the subshell.

        Note:
            In var=$(some_command); echo $? the output is the exit status of some_command, which is executed in a subshell environment, but this is because its exit status becomes the exit status of the assignment command var=$(some_command) (see 2.9.1 Simple Commands) and this assignment command is the most recently completed pipeline. Likewise for any pipeline consisting entirely of a simple command that has no command word, but contains one or more command substitutions. (See 2.9.1 Simple Commands.)

*
        (Hyphen.) Expands to the current option flags (the single-letter option names concatenated into a string) as specified on invocation, by the set special built-in command, or implicitly by the shell. It is unspecified whether the -c and -s options are included in the expansion of "$-". The -i option shall be included in "$-" if the shell is interactive, regardless of whether it was specified on invocation.
$
        Expands to the shortest representation of the decimal process ID of the invoked shell. In a subshell (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment), '$' shall expand to the same value as that of the current shell.
!
        Expands to the shortest representation of the decimal process ID associated with the most recent asynchronous AND-OR list (see 2.9.3.1 Asynchronous AND-OR Lists) executed from the current shell execution environment, or to the shortest representation of the decimal process ID of the last command specified in the currently executing pipeline in the job-control background job that most recently resumed execution through the use of bg, whichever is the most recent.
0
        (Zero.) Expands to the name of the shell or shell script. See sh for a detailed description of how this name is derived.

See the description of the IFS variable in 2.5.3 Shell Variables.
1.5.3 Shell Variables

Variables shall be initialized from the environment (as defined by XBD 8. Environment Variables and the exec function in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024) and can be given new values with variable assignment commands. Shell variables shall be initialized only from environment variables that have valid names. If a variable is initialized from the environment, it shall be marked for export immediately; see the export special built-in. New variables can be defined and initialized with variable assignments, with the read or getopts utilities, with the name parameter in a for loop, with the ${name=word} expansion, or with other mechanisms provided as implementation extensions.

The following variables shall affect the execution of the shell:


## ENV
        [UP] [Option Start] The processing of the ENV shell variable shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

        This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion) by the shell and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of a file. Before any interactive commands are read, the shell shall tokenize (see 2.3 Token Recognition) the contents of the file, parse the tokens as a program (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), and execute the resulting commands in the current environment. (In other words, the contents of the ENV file are not parsed as a single compound_list. This distinction matters because it influences when aliases take effect.) The file need not be executable. If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified. ENV shall be ignored if the user's real and effective user IDs or real and effective group IDs are different.

## HOME
        The pathname of the user's home directory. The contents of HOME are used in tilde expansion (see 2.6.1 Tilde Expansion).

## IFS
        A string treated as a list of characters that is used for field splitting, expansion of the '*' special parameter, and to split lines into fields with the read utility. If the value of IFS includes any bytes that do not form part of a valid character, the results of field splitting, expansion of '*', and use of the read utility are unspecified.

        If IFS is not set, it shall behave as normal for an unset variable, except that field splitting by the shell and line splitting by the read utility shall be performed as if the value of IFS is ; see 2.6.5 Field Splitting.

        The shell shall set IFS to  when it is invoked.

## LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See XBD 8.2 Internationalization Variables for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL
        The value of this variable overrides the LC_* variables and LANG , as described in XBD 8. Environment Variables.
LC_COLLATE
        Determine the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements within pattern matching.
LC_CTYPE
        Determine the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters), which characters are defined as letters (character class alpha) and  characters (character class blank), and the behavior of character classes within pattern matching. Changing the value of LC_CTYPE after the shell has started shall not affect the lexical processing of shell commands in the current shell execution environment or its subshells. Invoking a shell script or performing exec sh subjects the new shell to the changes in LC_CTYPE .
LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the language in which messages should be written.

## LINENO
        [UP] [Option Start] The processing of the LINENO shell variable shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

        Set by the shell to a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (numbered starting with 1) within a script or function before it executes each command. If the user unsets or resets LINENO , the variable may lose its special meaning for the life of the shell. If the shell is not currently executing a script or function, the value of LINENO is unspecified.

## NLSPATH
        [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]

## PATH
        A string formatted as described in XBD 8. Environment Variables, used to effect command interpretation; see 2.9.1.4 Command Search and Execution.

## PPID
        Set by the shell to the decimal value of its parent process ID during initialization of the shell. In a subshell (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment), PPID shall be set to the same value as that of the parent of the current shell. For example, echo $PPID and (echo $PPID ) would produce the same value.
PS1
        [UP] [Option Start] The processing of the PS1 shell variable shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

        Each time an interactive shell is ready to read a command, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion) and exclamation-mark expansion (see below). Whether the value is also subjected to command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution) or arithmetic expansion (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion) or both is unspecified. After expansion, the value shall be written to standard error.

        The expansions shall be performed in two passes, where the result of the first pass is input to the second pass. One of the passes shall perform only the exclamation-mark expansion described below. The other pass shall perform the other expansion(s) according to the rules in 2.6 Word Expansions. Which of the two passes is performed first is unspecified.

        The default value shall be "$ ". For users who have specific additional implementation-defined privileges, the default may be another, implementation-defined value.

        Exclamation-mark expansion: The shell shall replace each instance of the  character ('!') with the history file number (see Command History List) of the next command to be typed. An  character escaped by another  character (that is, "!!") shall expand to a single  character.
PS2
        [UP] [Option Start] The processing of the PS2 shell variable shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

        Each time the user enters a  prior to completing a command line in an interactive shell, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion). Whether the value is also subjected to command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution) or arithmetic expansion (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion) or both is unspecified. After expansion, the value shall be written to standard error. The default value shall be "> ".
PS4
        [UP] [Option Start] The processing of the PS4 shell variable shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

        When an execution trace (set -x) is being performed, before each line in the execution trace, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion). Whether the value is also subjected to command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution) or arithmetic expansion (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion) or both is unspecified. After expansion, the value shall be written to standard error. The default value shall be "+ ".

## PWD
        Set by the shell and by the cd utility. In the shell the value shall be initialized from the environment as follows. If a value for PWD is passed to the shell in the environment when it is executed, the value is an absolute pathname of the current working directory that is no longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes including the terminating null byte, and the value does not contain any components that are dot or dot-dot, then the shell shall set PWD to the value from the environment. Otherwise, if a value for PWD is passed to the shell in the environment when it is executed, the value is an absolute pathname of the current working directory, and the value does not contain any components that are dot or dot-dot, then it is unspecified whether the shell sets PWD to the value from the environment or sets PWD to the pathname that would be output by pwd -P. Otherwise, the sh utility sets PWD to the pathname that would be output by pwd -P. In cases where PWD is set to the value from the environment, the value can contain components that refer to files of type symbolic link. In cases where PWD is set to the pathname that would be output by pwd -P, if there is insufficient permission on the current working directory, or on any parent of that directory, to determine what that pathname would be, the value of PWD is unspecified. Assignments to this variable may be ignored. If an application sets or unsets the value of PWD , the behaviors of the cd and pwd utilities are unspecified.

1.6 Word Expansions

This section describes the various expansions that are performed on words. Not all expansions are performed on every word, as explained in the following sections and elsewhere in this chapter. The expansions that are performed for a given word shall be performed in the following order:

        Tilde expansion (see 2.6.1 Tilde Expansion), parameter expansion (see 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion), command substitution (see 2.6.3 Command Substitution ), and arithmetic expansion (see 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion) shall be performed, beginning to end. See item 5 in 2.3 Token Recognition.
        Field splitting (see 2.6.5 Field Splitting) shall be performed on the portions of the fields generated by step 1.
        Pathname expansion (see 2.6.6 Pathname Expansion) shall be performed, unless set -f is in effect.
        Quote removal (see 2.6.7 Quote Removal), if performed, shall always be performed last.

Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions, arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a single word shall expand to a single field, except as described below. The shell shall create multiple fields or no fields from a single word only as a result of field splitting, pathname expansion, or the following cases:

        Parameter expansion of the special parameters '@' and '*', as described in 2.5.2 Special Parameters, can create multiple fields or no fields from a single word.
        When the expansion occurs in a context where field splitting will be performed, a word that contains all of the following somewhere within it, before any expansions are applied, in the order specified:
            an unquoted  ('{') that is not immediately preceded by an unquoted  ('$')
*ne or more unquoted  (',') characters or a sequence that consists of two adjacent  ('.') characters surrounded by other characters (which can also be  characters)
            an unquoted  ('}')

        may be subject to an additional implementation-defined form of expansion that can create multiple fields from a single word. This expansion, if supported, shall be applied before all the other word expansions are applied. The other expansions shall then be applied to each field that results from this expansion.

When the expansions in this section are performed other than in the context of preparing a command for execution, they shall be carried out in the current shell execution environment.

When expanding words for a command about to be executed, and the word will be the command name or an argument to the command, the expansions shall be carried out in the current shell execution environment. (The environment for the command to be executed is unknown until the command word is known.)

When expanding the words in a command about to be executed that are used with variable assignments or redirections, it is unspecified whether the expansions are carried out in the current execution environment or in the environment of the command about to be executed.

The '$' character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic evaluation. If a '$' that is neither within single-quotes nor escaped by a  is immediately followed by a character that is not a , not a , not a , and is not one of the following:

        A numeric character
        The name of one of the special parameters (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters)
        A valid first character of a variable name
        A  ('{')

##     A 
        A single-quote

the result is unspecified. If a '$' that is neither within single-quotes nor escaped by a  is immediately followed by a , , or a , or is not followed by any character, the '$' shall be treated as a literal character.
1.6.1 Tilde Expansion

A "tilde-prefix" consists of an unquoted  character at the beginning of a word, followed by all of the characters preceding the first unquoted  in the word, or all the characters in the word if there is no . In an assignment (see XBD 4.26 Variable Assignment), multiple tilde-prefixes can be used: one at the beginning of the word (that is, following the  of the assignment), or one following any unquoted , or both. A tilde-prefix in an assignment is terminated by the first unquoted  or , or the end of the assignment word.

If the tilde-prefix consists of only the  character, it shall be replaced by the value of the variable HOME . If HOME is unset, the results are unspecified.

Otherwise, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the  shall be treated as a possible login name from the user database. If these characters do not form a portable login name (see the description of the LOGNAME environment variable in XBD 8.3 Other Environment Variables), the results are unspecified.

Note:
        Since the tilde-prefix is not subject to further word expansions after the  is removed to obtain the login name, none of the following has a portable login name following the :

        ~"string"
        ~'string'
        ~$var
        ~\/bin

*wing to the presence of '"', '\'', '$', '\\', and '/' characters in the login name.

If the characters in the tilde-prefix following the  form a portable login name, the tilde-prefix shall be replaced by a pathname of the initial working directory associated with the login name. The pathname shall be obtained as if by using the getpwnam() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024. If the system does not recognize the login name, the results are unspecified.

The pathname that replaces the tilde-prefix shall be treated as if quoted to prevent it being altered by field splitting and pathname expansion; if a  follows the tilde-prefix and the pathname ends with a , the trailing  from the pathname should be omitted from the replacement. If the word being expanded consists of only the  character and HOME is set to the null string, this produces an empty field (as opposed to zero fields) as the expanded word.

Note:
        A future version of this standard may require that if a  follows the tilde-prefix and the pathname ends with a , the trailing  from the pathname is omitted from the replacement.

1.6.2 Parameter Expansion

The format for parameter expansion is as follows:

${expression}

where expression consists of all characters until the matching '}'. Any '}' escaped by a  or within a quoted string, and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command substitutions, and variable expansions, shall not be examined in determining the matching '}'.

The simplest form for parameter expansion is:

${parameter}

The value, if any, of parameter shall be substituted.

The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are optional except for positional parameters with more than one digit or when parameter is a name and is followed by a character that could be interpreted as part of the name.

For a parameter that is not enclosed in braces:

        If the parameter is a name, the expansion shall use the longest valid name (see XBD 3.216 Name), whether or not the variable denoted by that name exists.
        Otherwise, the parameter is a single-character symbol, and behavior is unspecified if that character is neither a digit nor one of the special parameters (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters).

In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of the following formats. In each case that a value of word is needed (based on the state of parameter, as described below), word shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. If word is not needed, it shall not be expanded. The '}' character that delimits the following parameter expansion modifications shall be determined as described previously in this section and in 2.2.3 Double-Quotes. If parameter is '*' or '@', the result of the expansion is unspecified.

${parameter:-[word]}
        Use Default Values. If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word (or an empty string if word is omitted) shall be substituted; otherwise, the value of parameter shall be substituted.
${parameter:=[word]}
        Assign Default Values. If parameter is unset or null, quote removal shall be performed on the expansion of word and the result (or an empty string if word is omitted) shall be assigned to parameter. In all cases, the final value of parameter shall be substituted. Only variables, not positional parameters or special parameters, can be assigned in this way.
${parameter:?[word]}
        Indicate Error if Null or Unset. If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word (or a message indicating it is unset if word is omitted) shall be written to standard error and the shell exits with a non-zero exit status. Otherwise, the value of parameter shall be substituted. An interactive shell need not exit.
${parameter:+[word]}
        Use Alternative Value. If parameter is unset or null, null shall be substituted; otherwise, the expansion of word (or an empty string if word is omitted) shall be substituted.

In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the  in the format shall result in a test for a parameter that is unset or null; omission of the  shall result in a test for a parameter that is only unset. If parameter is '#' and the colon is omitted, the application shall ensure that word is specified (this is necessary to avoid ambiguity with the string length expansion). The following table summarizes the effect of the :


##  
	

parameter Set and Not Null
	

parameter Set But Null
	

parameter Unset

${parameter:-word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute word
	

substitute word

${parameter-word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

substitute word

${parameter:=word}
	

substitute parameter
	

assign word
	

assign word

${parameter=word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

assign word

${parameter:?word}
	

substitute parameter
	

error, exit
	

error, exit

${parameter?word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

error, exit

${parameter:+word}
	

substitute word
	

substitute null
	

substitute null

${parameter+word}
	

substitute word
	

substitute word
	

substitute null

In all cases shown with "substitute", the expression is replaced with the value shown. In all cases shown with "assign", parameter is assigned that value, which also replaces the expression.

${#parameter}
        String Length. The shortest decimal representation of the length in characters of the value of parameter shall be substituted. If parameter is '*' or '@', the result of the expansion is unspecified. If parameter is unset and set -u is in effect, the expansion shall fail.

The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for character substring processing. In each case, pattern matching notation (see 2.14 Pattern Matching Notation), rather than regular expression notation, shall be used to evaluate the patterns. If parameter is '#', '*', or '@', the result of the expansion is unspecified. If parameter is unset and set -u is in effect, the expansion shall fail. Enclosing the full parameter expansion string in double-quotes shall not cause the following four varieties of pattern characters to be quoted, whereas quoting characters within the braces shall have this effect. In each variety, if word is omitted, the empty pattern shall be used.

${parameter%[word]}
        Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the smallest portion of the suffix matched by the pattern deleted. If present, word shall not begin with an unquoted '%'.
${parameter%%[word]}
        Remove Largest Suffix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the largest portion of the suffix matched by the pattern deleted.
${parameter#[word]}
        Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the smallest portion of the prefix matched by the pattern deleted. If present, word shall not begin with an unquoted '#'.
${parameter##[word]}
        Remove Largest Prefix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the largest portion of the prefix matched by the pattern deleted.

The following sections are informative.
Examples

${parameter}

        In this example, the effects of omitting braces are demonstrated.

        a=1
        set 2
        echo ${a}b-$ab-${1}0-${10}-$10
        1b--20--20

${parameter-word}

        This example demonstrates the difference between unset and set to the empty string, as well as the rules for finding the delimiting close brace.

            foo=asdf
            echo ${foo-bar}xyz}
            asdfxyz}
            foo=
            echo ${foo-bar}xyz}
            xyz}
            unset foo
            echo ${foo-bar}xyz}
            barxyz}

${parameter:-word}

        In this example, ls is executed only if x is null or unset. (The $(ls) command substitution notation is explained in 2.6.3 Command Substitution.)

        ${x:-$(ls)}

${parameter:=word}

        unset X
        echo ${X:=abc}
        abc

${parameter:?word}

        unset posix
        echo ${posix:?}
        sh: posix: parameter null or not set

${parameter:+word}

        set a b c
        echo ${3:+posix}
        posix

${#parameter}

        HOME=/usr/posix
        echo ${#HOME}
        10

${parameter%word}

        x=file.c
        echo ${x%.c}.o
        file.o

${parameter%%word}

        x=posix/src/std
        echo ${x%%/*}
        posix

${parameter#word}

        x=$HOME/src/cmd
        echo ${x#$HOME}
        /src/cmd

${parameter##word}

        x=/one/two/three
        echo ${x##*/}
        three

The double-quoting of patterns is different depending on where the double-quotes are placed:

"${x#*}"
        The  is a pattern character.
${x#"*"}
        The literal  is quoted and not special.

End of informative text.
1.6.3 Command Substitution

Command substitution allows the output of one or more commands to be substituted in place of the commands themselves. Command substitution shall occur when command(s) are enclosed as follows:

$(commands)

*r (backquoted version):

`commands`

The shell shall expand the command substitution by executing commands in a subshell environment (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment) and replacing the command substitution (the text of the commands string plus the enclosing "$()" or backquotes) with the standard output of the command(s); if the output ends with one or more bytes that have the encoded value of a  character, they shall not be included in the replacement. Any such bytes that occur elsewhere shall be included in the replacement; however, they might be treated as field delimiters and eliminated during field splitting, depending on the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect. If the output contains any null bytes, the behavior is unspecified.

Within the backquoted style of command substitution, if the command substitution is not within double-quotes,  shall retain its literal meaning, except when followed by: '$', '`', or . See 2.2.3 Double-Quotes for the handling of  when the command substitution is within double-quotes. The search for the matching backquote shall be satisfied by the first unquoted non-escaped backquote; during this search, if a non-escaped backquote is encountered within a shell comment, a here-document, an embedded command substitution of the $(commands) form, or a quoted string, undefined results occur. A quoted string that begins, but does not end, within the "`...`" sequence produces undefined results.

With the $(commands) form, all characters following the open parenthesis to the matching closing parenthesis constitute the commands string.

With both the backquoted and $(commands) forms, the commands string shall be tokenized (see 2.3 Token Recognition) and parsed (see 2.10 Shell Grammar). It is unspecified whether the commands string is parsed and executed incrementally as a program (as for a shell script), or is parsed as a single compound_list that is executed after the string has been completely parsed. In addition, it is unspecified whether the terminating ')' of the $(commands) form can result from alias substitution. With the $(commands) form any syntactically correct program can be used for commands, except that:

        If the commands string consists solely of redirections, the results are unspecified.
        If the commands string is parsed as a single compound_list, before any commands are executed, alias and unalias commands in commands have no effect during parsing (see 2.3.1 Alias Substitution). Strictly conforming applications shall ensure that the commands string does not depend on alias changes taking effect incrementally as would be the case if parsed and executed as a program.
        The behavior is unspecified if the terminating ')' is not present in the token containing the command substitution; that is, if the ')' is expected to result from alias substitution.

The results of command substitution shall not be processed for further tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.

Command substitution can be nested. To specify nesting within the backquoted version, the application shall precede the inner backquotes with  characters; for example:

\`commands\`

The syntax of the shell command language has an ambiguity for expansions beginning with "$((", which can introduce an arithmetic expansion or a command substitution that starts with a subshell. Arithmetic expansion has precedence; that is, the shell shall first determine whether it can parse the expansion as an arithmetic expansion and shall only parse the expansion as a command substitution if it determines that it cannot parse the expansion as an arithmetic expansion. The shell need not evaluate nested expansions when performing this determination. If it encounters the end of input without already having determined that it cannot parse the expansion as an arithmetic expansion, the shell shall treat the expansion as an incomplete arithmetic expansion and report a syntax error. A conforming application shall ensure that it separates the "$(" and '(' into two tokens (that is, separate them with white space) in a command substitution that starts with a subshell. For example, a command substitution containing a single subshell could be written as:

$( (commands) )

1.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an arithmetic expression and substituting its value. The format for arithmetic expansion shall be as follows:

$((expression))

The expression shall be treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated specially. The shell shall expand all tokens in the expression for parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.

Next, the shell shall treat this as an arithmetic expression and substitute the value of the expression. The arithmetic expression shall be processed according to the rules given in 1.1.2.1 Arithmetic Precision and Operations, with the following exceptions:

        Only signed long integer arithmetic is required.
        Only the decimal-constant, octal-constant, and hexadecimal-constant constants specified in the ISO C standard, Section 6.4.4.1 are required to be recognized as constants.
        The sizeof() operator and the prefix and postfix "++" and "--" operators are not required.
        Selection, iteration, and jump statements are not supported.

All changes to variables in an arithmetic expression shall be in effect after the arithmetic expansion, as in the parameter expansion "${x=value}".

If the shell variable x contains a value that forms a valid integer constant, optionally including a leading  or , then the arithmetic expansions "$((x))" and "$(($x))" shall return the same value.

As an extension, the shell may recognize arithmetic expressions beyond those listed. The shell may use a signed integer type with a rank larger than the rank of signed long. The shell may use a real-floating type instead of signed long as long as it does not affect the results in cases where there is no overflow. If the expression is invalid, or the contents of a shell variable used in the expression are not recognized by the shell, the expansion fails and the shell shall write a diagnostic message to standard error indicating the failure.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

A simple example using arithmetic expansion:

# repeat a command 100 times
x=100
while [ $x -gt 0 ]
do
        command
        x=$(($x-1))
done

End of informative text.
1.6.5 Field Splitting

After parameter expansion ( 2.6.2 Parameter Expansion), command substitution ( 2.6.3 Command Substitution), and arithmetic expansion ( 2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion), if the shell variable IFS (see 2.5.3 Shell Variables) is set and its value is not empty, or if IFS is unset, the shell shall scan each field containing results of expansions and substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field splitting; zero, one or multiple fields can result.

For the remainder of this section, any reference to the results of an expansion, or results of expansions, shall be interpreted to mean the results from one or more unquoted variable or arithmetic expansions, or unquoted command substitutions.

If the IFS variable is set and has an empty string as its value, no field splitting shall occur. However, if an input field which contained the results of an expansion is entirely empty, it shall be removed. Note that this occurs before quote removal; any input field that contains any quoting characters can never be empty at this point. After the removal of any such fields from the input, the possibly modified input field list shall become the output.

Each input field shall be considered in sequence, first to last, with the results of the algorithm described in this section causing output fields to be generated, which shall remain in the same order as the input fields from which they originated.

Fields which contain no results from expansions shall not be affected by field splitting, and shall remain unaltered, simply moving from the list of input fields to be next in the list of output fields.

In the remainder of this description, it is assumed that there is present in the field at least one expansion result; this assumption will not be restated. Field splitting only ever alters those parts of the field.

For the purposes of this section, the term "IFS white space" is used to mean any of the white-space bytes (see XBD 3.413 White Space, 3.414 White-Space Byte, and 3.415 White-Space Character) , , or  from the portable character set (see XBD 6.1 Portable Character Set) which are present in the value of the IFS variable, and perhaps other white-space characters. It is implementation-defined whether other white-space characters which appear in the value of IFS are also considered as "IFS white space". The three characters above specified as IFS white-space bytes are always IFS white space, when they occur in the value of IFS , regardless of whether they are white-space characters in any relevant locale. For other locale-specific white-space characters allowed by the implementation it is unspecified whether the character is considered as IFS white space if it is white space at the time it is assigned to the IFS variable, or if it is white space at the time field splitting occurs. (The locale might have changed between those events.)

If the IFS variable is unset, then for the purposes of this section, but without altering the value of the variable, its value shall be considered to contain the three single-byte characters , , and  from the portable character set, all of which are IFS white-space characters.

The shell shall use the byte sequences that form the characters in the value of the IFS variable as delimiters. Each of the characters , , and  which appears in the value of IFS shall be a single-byte delimiter. The shell shall use these delimiters as field terminators to split the results of expansions, along with other adjacent bytes, into separate fields, as described below. Note that these delimiters terminate a field; they do not, of themselves, cause a new field to start—subsequent bytes that are not from the results of an expansion, or that do not form IFS white-space characters are required for a new field to begin.

Note that the shell processes arbitrary bytes from the input fields; there is no requirement that those bytes form valid characters.

If the results of the algorithm are that no fields are delimited; that is, if the input field is wholly empty or consists entirely of IFS white space, the result shall be zero fields (rather than an empty field).

For the purposes of this section, when a field is said to be delimited, then the candidate field, as generated below shall become an output field. When the algorithm transforms a candidate into an output field it shall be appended to the current list of output fields.

Each field containing the results from an expansion shall be processed in order, intermixed with fields not containing the results of expansions, processed as described above, as if by using the following algorithm, examining bytes in the input field, from beginning to end:

        Begin with an empty candidate field and the input as specified above.
        When instructed to start the next iteration of the loop, this is the start of the loop. While the input (as modified by earlier iterations of this loop) is not empty:
            Consider the leading remaining byte or byte sequence of the input. No such byte sequence shall contain data such that some bytes in the sequence resulted from an expansion, and others did not, nor which contains bytes resulting from the results of more than one expansion. If the byte or sequence of bytes is:
                A byte (or sequence of bytes) in the input which did not result from an expansion:

                Append this byte (or sequence) to the candidate, and remove it from the input. Start the next iteration of the loop.
                A byte sequence in the input which resulted from an expansion and which does not form a character in IFS :

                Append the first byte of the sequence to the candidate, and remove that byte from the input. Start the next iteration of the loop.
                A byte sequence in the input which resulted from an expansion and which forms an IFS white space character:

                Remove that byte sequence from the input, consider the new leading input byte sequence, and repeat this step.
                A byte sequence in the input which resulted from an expansion and which forms an IFS character that is not IFS white space:

                Remove that byte sequence from the input, but note it was observed.

            At this point, if the candidate is not empty, or if a sequence of bytes representing an IFS character that is not IFS white space was seen at step 4, then a field is said to have been delimited, and the candidate shall become an output field.
            Empty (clear) the candidate, and start the next iteration of the loop.
        Once the input is empty, the candidate shall become an output field if and only if it is not empty.

The ordered list of output fields so produced, which might be empty, shall replace the list of input fields.
1.6.6 Pathname Expansion

After field splitting, if set -f is not in effect, each field in the resulting command line shall be expanded using the algorithm described in 2.14 Pattern Matching Notation, qualified by the rules in 2.14.3 Patterns Used for Filename Expansion.
1.6.7 Quote Removal

The quote character sequence  single-quote and the single-character quote characters (, single-quote, and double-quote) that were present in the original word shall be removed unless they have themselves been quoted. Note that the single-quote character that terminates a  single-quote sequence is itself a single-character quote character.

Note:
        After quote removal the shell still remembers which characters were quoted. This is necessary for purposes such as matching patterns in a case conditional construct (see 2.9.4.3 Case Conditional Construct and 2.14 Pattern Matching Notation).

1.7 Redirection

Redirection is used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment) or for any command. Redirection operators can be used with numbers representing file descriptors (see XBD 3.141 File Descriptor) as described below.

The overall format used for redirection is:

[n]redir-op word

The number n is an optional one or more digit decimal number designating the file descriptor number; the application shall ensure it is delimited from any preceding text and immediately precedes the redirection operator redir-op (with no intervening  characters allowed). If n is quoted, the number shall not be recognized as part of the redirection expression. For example:

echo \2>a

writes the character 2 into file a. If any part of redir-op is quoted, no redirection expression is recognized. For example:

echo 2\>a

writes the characters 2>a to standard output. The optional number, redirection operator, and word shall not appear in the arguments provided to the command to be executed (if any).

The shell may support an additional format used for redirection:

{location}redir-op word

where location is non-empty and indicates a location where an integer value can be stored, such as the name of a shell variable. If this format is supported its behavior is implementation-defined.

The largest file descriptor number supported in shell redirections is implementation-defined; however, all implementations shall support at least 0 to 9, inclusive, for use by the application.

If the redirection operator is "<<" or "<<-", the word that follows the redirection operator shall be subjected to quote removal; it is unspecified whether any of the other expansions occur. For the other redirection operators, the word that follows the redirection operator shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. Pathname expansion shall not be performed on the word by a non-interactive shell; an interactive shell may perform it, but if the expansion would result in more than one word it is unspecified whether the redirection proceeds without pathname expansion being performed or the redirection fails.

Note:
        A future version of this standard may require that the redirection fails in this case.

If more than one redirection operator is specified with a command, the order of evaluation is from beginning to end.

A failure to open or create a file shall cause a redirection to fail.
1.7.1 Redirecting Input

Input redirection shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for reading on the designated file descriptor, or standard input if the file descriptor is not specified.

The general format for redirecting input is:

[n]<word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection shall refer to standard input (file descriptor 0).
1.7.2 Redirecting Output

The two general formats for redirecting output are:

[n]>word
[n]>|word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection shall refer to standard output (file descriptor 1).

Output redirection using the '>' format shall fail if the noclobber option is set (see the description of set -C) and the file named by the expansion of word exists and is either a regular file or a symbolic link that resolves to a regular file; it may also fail if the file is a symbolic link that does not resolve to an existing file. The check for existence, file creation, and open operations shall be performed atomically as is done by the open() function as defined in System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 when the O_CREAT and O_EXCL flags are set, except that if the file exists and is a symbolic link, the open operation need not fail with [EEXIST] unless the symbolic link resolves to an existing regular file. Performing these operations atomically ensures that the creation of lock files and unique (often temporary) files is reliable, with important caveats detailed in C.2.7.2 Redirecting Output. The check for the type of the file need not be performed atomically with the check for existence, file creation, and open operations. If not, there is a potential race condition that may result in a misleading shell diagnostic message when redirection fails. See XRAT C.2.7.2 Redirecting Output for more details.

In all other cases (noclobber not set, redirection using '>' does not fail for the reasons stated above, or redirection using the ">|" format), output redirection shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for output on the designated file descriptor, or standard output if none is specified. If the file does not exist, it shall be created as an empty file; otherwise, it shall be opened as if the open() function was called with the O_TRUNC flag set.
1.7.3 Appending Redirected Output

Appended output redirection shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for output on the designated file descriptor. The file shall be opened as if the open() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 was called with the O_APPEND flag set. If the file does not exist, it shall be created.

The general format for appending redirected output is as follows:

[n]>>word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection refers to standard output (file descriptor 1).
1.7.4 Here-Document

The redirection operators "<<" and "<<-" both allow redirection of subsequent lines read by the shell to the input of a command. The redirected lines are known as a "here-document".

The here-document shall be treated as a single word that begins after the next NEWLINE token and continues until there is a line containing only the delimiter and a , with no  characters in between. Then the next here-document starts, if there is one. For the purposes of locating this terminating line, the end of a command_string operand (see sh) shall be treated as a  character, and the end of the commands string in $(commands) and `commands` may be treated as a . If the end of input is reached without finding the terminating line, the shell should, but need not, treat this as a redirection error. The format is as follows:

[n]<<word
        here-document
delimiter

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the here-document refers to standard input (file descriptor 0). It is unspecified whether the file descriptor is opened as a regular file or some other type of file. Portable applications cannot rely on the file descriptor being seekable (see XSH lseek()).

If any part of word is quoted, not counting double-quotes outside a command substitution if the here-document is inside one, the delimiter shall be formed by performing quote removal on word, and the here-document lines shall not be expanded. Otherwise:

        The delimiter shall be the word itself.
        The removal of  for line continuation (see 2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash)) shall be performed during the search for the trailing delimiter. (As a consequence, the trailing delimiter is not recognized immediately after a  that was removed by line continuation.) It is unspecified whether the line containing the trailing delimiter is itself subject to this line continuation.
        All lines of the here-document shall be expanded, when the redirection operator is evaluated but after the trailing delimiter for the here-document has been located, for parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. If the redirection operator is never evaluated (because the command it is part of is not executed), the here-document shall be read without performing any expansions.
        Any  characters in the input shall behave as the  inside double-quotes (see 2.2.3 Double-Quotes). However, the double-quote character ('"') shall not be treated specially within a here-document, except when the double-quote appears within "$()", "``", or "${}".

If the redirection operator is " characters shall be stripped from input lines after  line continuation (when it applies) has been performed, and from the line containing the trailing delimiter. Stripping of leading  characters shall occur as the here-document is read from the shell input (and consequently does not affect any  characters that result from expansions).

If more than one "<<" or "<<-" operator is specified on a line, the here-document associated with the first operator shall be supplied first by the application and shall be read first by the shell.

When a here-document is read from a terminal device and the shell is interactive, it shall write the contents of the variable PS2, processed as described in 2.5.3 Shell Variables, to standard error before reading each line of input until the delimiter has been recognized.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

An example of a here-document follows:

cat <<eof1; cat <<eof2
Hi,
eof1
Helene.
eof2

End of informative text.
1.7.5 Duplicating an Input File Descriptor

The redirection operator:

[n]<&word

shall duplicate one input file descriptor from another, or shall close one. If word evaluates to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard input if n is not specified, shall be made to be a copy of the file descriptor denoted by word; if the digits in word do not represent an already open file descriptor, a redirection error shall result (see 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors); if the file descriptor denoted by word represents an open file descriptor that is not open for input, a redirection error may result. If word evaluates to '-', file descriptor n, or standard input if n is not specified, shall be closed. Attempts to close a file descriptor that is not open shall not constitute an error. If word evaluates to something else, the behavior is unspecified.
1.7.6 Duplicating an Output File Descriptor

The redirection operator:

[n]>&word

shall duplicate one output file descriptor from another, or shall close one. If word evaluates to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard output if n is not specified, shall be made to be a copy of the file descriptor denoted by word; if the digits in word do not represent an already open file descriptor, a redirection error shall result (see 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors); if the file descriptor denoted by word represents an open file descriptor that is not open for output, a redirection error may result. If word evaluates to '-', file descriptor n, or standard output if n is not specified, is closed. Attempts to close a file descriptor that is not open shall not constitute an error. If word evaluates to something else, the behavior is unspecified.
1.7.7 Open File Descriptors for Reading and Writing

The redirection operator:

[n]word

shall cause the file whose name is the expansion of word to be opened for both reading and writing on the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard input if n is not specified. If the file does not exist, it shall be created.
1.8 Exit Status and Errors
1.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors

Certain errors shall cause the shell to write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit as shown in the following table:

Error
	

Non-Interactive
Shell
	

Interactive Shell
	

Shell Diagnostic
Message Required

Shell language syntax error
	

shall exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Special built-in utility error
	

shall exit1
	

shall not exit
	

no2

Other utility (not a special
built-in) error
	

shall not exit
	

shall not exit
	

no3

Redirection error with
special built-in utilities
	

shall exit

yes

Redirection error with
function execution
	

shall not exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Redirection error with other
utilities (not special built-ins)
	

shall not exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Variable assignment error
	

shall exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Expansion error
	

shall exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Command not found
	

may exit
	

shall not exit
	

yes

Unrecoverable read error
when reading commands
	

shall exit4
	

shall exit4
	

yes
Notes:

        The shell shall exit only if the special built-in utility is executed directly. If it is executed via the command utility, the shell shall not exit.
        Although special built-ins are part of the shell, a diagnostic message written by a special built-in is not considered to be a shell diagnostic message, and can be redirected like any other utility.
        The shell is not required to write a diagnostic message, but the utility itself shall write a diagnostic message if required to do so.
        If an unrecoverable read error occurs when reading commands, other than from the file operand of the dot special built-in, the shell shall execute no further commands (including any already successfully read but not yet executed) other than any specified in a previously defined EXIT trap action. An unrecoverable read error while reading from the file operand of the dot special built-in shall be treated as a special built-in utility error.

An expansion error is one that occurs when the shell expansions defined in 2.6 Word Expansions are carried out (for example, "${x!y}", because '!' is not a valid operator); an implementation may treat these as syntax errors if it is able to detect them during tokenization, rather than during expansion.

If any of the errors shown as "shall exit" or "may exit" occur in a subshell environment, the shell shall (respectively, may) exit from the subshell environment with a non-zero status and continue in the environment from which that subshell environment was invoked.

In all of the cases shown in the table where an interactive shell is required not to exit and a non-interactive shell is required to exit, an interactive shell shall not perform any further processing of the command in which the error occurred.
1.8.2 Exit Status for Commands

Each command has an exit status that can influence the behavior of other shell commands. The exit status of commands that are not utilities is documented in this section. The exit status of the standard utilities is documented in their respective sections.

The exit status of a command shall be determined as follows:

        If the command is not found, the exit status shall be 127.
        Otherwise, if the command name is found, but it is not an executable utility, the exit status shall be 126.
        Otherwise, if the command terminated due to the receipt of a signal, the shell shall assign it an exit status greater than 128. The exit status shall identify, in an implementation-defined manner, which signal terminated the command. Note that shell implementations are permitted to assign an exit status greater than 255 if a command terminates due to a signal.
        Otherwise, the exit status shall be the value obtained by the equivalent of the WEXITSTATUS macro applied to the status obtained by the wait() function (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024). Note that for C programs, this value is equal to the result of performing a modulo 256 operation on the value passed to _Exit(), _exit(), or exit() or returned from main().

1.9 Shell Commands

This section describes the basic structure of shell commands. The following command descriptions each describe a format of the command that is only used to aid the reader in recognizing the command type, and does not formally represent the syntax. In particular, the representations include spacing between tokens in some places where s would not be necessary (when one of the tokens is an operator). Each description discusses the semantics of the command; for a formal definition of the command language, consult 2.10 Shell Grammar.

A command is one of the following:

        Simple command (see 2.9.1 Simple Commands)
        Pipeline (see 2.9.2 Pipelines)
        List compound-list (see 2.9.3 Lists)
        Compound command (see 2.9.4 Compound Commands)
        Function definition (see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command)

Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command shall be that of the last simple command executed by the command. There shall be no limit on the size of any shell command other than that imposed by the underlying system (memory constraints, {ARG_MAX}, and so on).
1.9.1 Simple Commands

A "simple command" is a sequence of optional variable assignments and redirections, in any sequence, optionally followed by words and redirections.
1.9.1.1 Order of Processing

When a given simple command is required to be executed (that is, when any conditional construct such as an AND-OR list or a case statement has not bypassed the simple command), the following expansions, assignments, and redirections shall all be performed from the beginning of the command text to the end:

        The words that are recognized as variable assignments or redirections according to 2.10.2 Shell Grammar Rules are saved for processing in steps 3 and 4.
        The first word (if any) that is not a variable assignment or redirection shall be expanded. If any fields remain following its expansion, the first field shall be considered the command name. If no fields remain, the next word (if any) shall be expanded, and so on, until a command name is found or no words remain. If there is a command name and it is recognized as a declaration utility, then any remaining words after the word that expanded to produce the command name, that would be recognized as a variable assignment in isolation, shall be expanded as a variable assignment (tilde expansion after the first  and after any unquoted , parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, but no field splitting or pathname expansion); while remaining words that would not be a variable assignment in isolation shall be subject to regular expansion (tilde expansion for only a leading , parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, field splitting, pathname expansion, and quote removal). For all other command names, words after the word that produced the command name shall be subject only to regular expansion. All fields resulting from the expansion of the word that produced the command name and the subsequent words, except for the field containing the command name, shall be the arguments for the command.
        Redirections shall be performed as described in 2.7 Redirection.
        Each variable assignment shall be expanded for tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal prior to assigning the value.

In the preceding list, the order of steps 3 and 4 may be reversed if no command name results from step 2 or if the command name matches the name of a special built-in utility; see 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities.

When determining whether a command name is a declaration utility, an implementation may use only lexical analysis. It is unspecified whether assignment context will be used if the command name would only become recognized as a declaration utility after word expansions.
1.9.1.2 Variable Assignments

Variable assignments shall be performed as follows:

        If no command name results, variable assignments shall affect the current execution environment.
        If the command name is not a special built-in utility or function, the variable assignments shall be exported for the execution environment of the command and shall not affect the current execution environment except as a side-effect of the expansions performed in step 4. In this case it is unspecified:
            Whether or not the assignments are visible for subsequent expansions in step 4
            Whether variable assignments made as side-effects of these expansions are visible for subsequent expansions in step 4, or in the current shell execution environment, or both
        If the command name is a standard utility implemented as a function (see XBD 4.25 Utility), the effect of variable assignments shall be as if the utility was not implemented as a function.
        If the command name is a special built-in utility, variable assignments shall affect the current execution environment before the utility is executed and remain in effect when the command completes; if an assigned variable is further modified by the utility, the modifications made by the utility shall persist. Unless the set -a option is on (see set), it is unspecified:
            Whether or not the variables gain the export attribute during the execution of the special built-in utility
            Whether or not export attributes gained as a result of the variable assignments persist after the completion of the special built-in utility
        If the command name is a function that is not a standard utility implemented as a function, variable assignments shall affect the current execution environment during the execution of the function. It is unspecified:
            Whether or not the variable assignments persist after the completion of the function
            Whether or not the variables gain the export attribute during the execution of the function
            Whether or not export attributes gained as a result of the variable assignments persist after the completion of the function (if variable assignments persist after the completion of the function)

If any of the variable assignments attempt to assign a value to a variable for which the readonly attribute is set in the current shell environment (regardless of whether the assignment is made in that environment), a variable assignment error shall occur. See 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of these errors.
1.9.1.3 Commands with no Command Name

If a simple command has no command name after word expansion (see 2.9.1.1 Order of Processing), any redirections shall be performed in a subshell environment; it is unspecified whether this subshell environment is the same one as that used for a command substitution within the command. (To affect the current execution environment, see the exec special built-in.) If any of the redirections performed in the current shell execution environment fail, the command shall immediately fail with an exit status greater than zero, and the shell shall write an error message indicating the failure. See 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of these failures on interactive and non-interactive shells.

Additionally, if there is no command name but the command contains a command substitution, the command shall complete with the exit status of the command substitution whose exit status was the last to be obtained. Otherwise, the command shall complete with a zero exit status.
1.9.1.4 Command Search and Execution

If a simple command has a command name and an optional list of arguments after word expansion (see 2.9.1.1 Order of Processing), the following actions shall be performed:

        If the command name does not contain any  characters, the first successful step in the following sequence shall occur:
            If the command name matches the name of a special built-in utility, that special built-in utility shall be invoked.
            If the command name matches the name of a utility listed in the following table, the results are unspecified.

            alloc
            autoload
            bind
            bindkey
            builtin

##          
            If the command name matches the name of a function known to this shell, the function shall be invoked as described in 2.9.5 Function Definition Command. If the implementation has provided a standard utility in the form of a function, and that function definition still exists (i.e. has not been removed using unset -f or replaced via another function definition with the same name), it shall not be recognized at this point. It shall be invoked in conjunction with the path search in step 1e.
            If the command name matches the name of an intrinsic utility (see 1.7 Intrinsic Utilities), that utility shall be invoked.
            Otherwise, the command shall be searched for using the PATH environment variable as described in XBD 8. Environment Variables:
                If the search is successful:
                    If the system has implemented the utility as a built-in or as a shell function, and the built-in or function is associated with the directory that was most recently tested during the successful PATH search, that built-in or function shall be invoked.
                    Otherwise, the shell shall execute a non-built-in utility as described in 2.9.1.6 Non-built-in Utility Execution.

                Once a utility has been searched for and found (either as a result of this specific search or as part of an unspecified shell start-up activity), an implementation may remember its location and need not search for the utility again unless the PATH variable has been the subject of an assignment. If the remembered location fails for a subsequent invocation, the shell shall repeat the search to find the new location for the utility, if any.
                If the search is unsuccessful, the command shall fail with an exit status of 127 and the shell shall write an error message.
        If the command name contains at least one , the shell shall execute a non-built-in utility as described in 2.9.1.6 Non-built-in Utility Execution.

1.9.1.5 Standard File Descriptors

If the utility would be executed with file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 closed, implementations may execute the utility with the file descriptor open to an unspecified file. If a standard utility or a conforming application is executed with file descriptor 0 not open for reading or with file descriptor 1 or 2 not open for writing, the environment in which the utility or application is executed shall be deemed non-conforming, and consequently the utility or application might not behave as described in this standard.
1.9.1.6 Non-built-in Utility Execution
When the shell executes a non-built-in utility, if the execution is not being made via the exec special built-in utility, the shell shall execute the utility in a separate utility environment (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment).

If the execution is being made via the exec special built-in utility, the shell shall not create a separate utility environment for this execution; the new process image shall replace the current shell execution environment. If the current shell environment is a subshell environment, the new process image shall replace the subshell environment and the shell shall continue in the environment from which that subshell environment was invoked.

In either case, execution of the utility in the specified environment shall be performed as follows:

        If the command name does not contain any  characters, the command name shall be searched for using the PATH environment variable as described in XBD 8. Environment Variables:
            If the search is successful, the shell shall execute the utility with actions equivalent to calling the execl() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 with the path argument set to the pathname resulting from the search, arg0 set to the command name, and the remaining execl() arguments set to the command arguments (if any) and the null terminator.

            If the execl() function fails due to an error equivalent to the [ENOEXEC] error defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024, the shell shall execute a command equivalent to having a shell invoked with the pathname resulting from the search as its first operand, with any remaining arguments passed to the new shell, except that the value of "$0" in the new shell may be set to the command name. The shell may apply a heuristic check to determine if the file to be executed could be a script and may bypass this command execution if it determines that the file cannot be a script. In this case, it shall write an error message, and the command shall fail with an exit status of 126.

            Note:
                A common heuristic for rejecting files that cannot be a script is locating a NUL byte prior to a  byte within a fixed-length prefix of the file. Since sh is required to accept input files with unlimited line lengths, the heuristic check cannot be based on line length.

            It is unspecified whether environment variables that were passed to the shell when it was invoked, but were not used to initialize shell variables (see 2.5.3 Shell Variables) because they had invalid names, are included in the environment passed to execl() and (if execl() fails as described above) to the new shell.
            If the search is unsuccessful, the command shall fail with an exit status of 127 and the shell shall write an error message.
        If the command name contains at least one :
            If the named utility exists, the shell shall execute the utility with actions equivalent to calling the execl() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 with the path and arg0 arguments set to the command name, and the remaining execl() arguments set to the command arguments (if any) and the null terminator.

            If the execl() function fails due to an error equivalent to the [ENOEXEC] error, the shell shall execute a command equivalent to having a shell invoked with the command name as its first operand, with any remaining arguments passed to the new shell. The shell may apply a heuristic check to determine if the file to be executed could be a script and may bypass this command execution if it determines that the file cannot be a script. In this case, it shall write an error message, and the command shall fail with an exit status of 126.

            Note:
                A common heuristic for rejecting files that cannot be a script is locating a NUL byte prior to a  byte within a fixed-length prefix of the file. Since sh is required to accept input files with unlimited line lengths, the heuristic check cannot be based on line length.

            It is unspecified whether environment variables that were passed to the shell when it was invoked, but were not used to initialize shell variables (see 2.5.3 Shell Variables) because they had invalid names, are included in the environment passed to execl() and (if execl() fails as described above) to the new shell.
            If the named utility does not exist, the command shall fail with an exit status of 127 and the shell shall write an error message.

1.9.2 Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control operator '|'. For each command but the last, the shell shall connect the standard output of the command to the standard input of the next command as if by creating a pipe and passing the write end of the pipe as the standard output of the command and the read end of the pipe as the standard input of the next command.

The format for a pipeline is:

[!] command1 [ | command2 ...]

If the pipeline begins with the reserved word ! and command1 is a subshell command, the application shall ensure that the ( operator at the beginning of command1 is separated from the ! by one or more  characters. The behavior of the reserved word ! immediately followed by the ( operator is unspecified.

The standard output of command1 shall be connected to the standard input of command2. The standard input, standard output, or both of a command shall be considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any redirection specified by redirection operators that are part of the command (see 2.7 Redirection).

If the pipeline is not in the background (see 2.9.3.1 Asynchronous AND-OR Lists and 2.11 Job Control), the shell shall wait for the last command specified in the pipeline to complete, and may also wait for all commands to complete.
Exit Status

The exit status of a pipeline shall depend on whether or not the pipefail option (see set) is enabled and whether or not the pipeline begins with the ! reserved word, as described in the following table. The pipefail option determines which command in the pipeline the exit status is derived from; the ! reserved word causes the exit status to be the logical NOT of the exit status of that command. The shell shall use the pipefail setting at the time it begins execution of the pipeline, not the setting at the time it sets the exit status of the pipeline. (For example, in command1 | set -o pipefail the exit status of command1 has no effect on the exit status of the pipeline, even if the shell executes set -o pipefail in the current shell environment.)

1.9.3 Lists

An AND-OR list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by the operators "&&" and "||".

A list is a sequence of one or more AND-OR lists separated by the operators ';' and '&'.

The operators "&&" and "||" shall have equal precedence and shall be evaluated with left associativity. For example, both of the following commands write solely bar to standard output:

false && echo foo || echo bar
true || echo foo && echo bar

A ';' separator or a ';' or  terminator shall cause the preceding AND-OR list to be executed sequentially; an '&' separator or terminator shall cause asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR list.

The term "compound-list" is derived from the grammar in 2.10 Shell Grammar; it is equivalent to a sequence of lists, separated by  characters, that can be preceded or followed by an arbitrary number of  characters.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

The following is an example that illustrates  characters in compound-lists:

while
        # a couple of s

        # a list
        date && who || ls; cat file
        # a couple of s

        # another list
        wc file > output & true

do
        # 2 lists
        ls
        cat file
done

End of informative text.
1.9.3.1 Asynchronous AND-OR Lists

If an AND-OR list is terminated by the control operator  ('&'), the shell shall execute the AND-OR list asynchronously in a subshell environment. This subshell shall execute in the background; that is, the shell shall not wait for the subshell to terminate before executing the next command (if any); if there are no further commands to execute, the shell shall not wait for the subshell to terminate before exiting.

If job control is enabled (see set, -m), the AND-OR list shall become a job-control background job and a job number shall be assigned to it. If job control is disabled, the AND-OR list may become a non-job-control background job, in which case a job number shall be assigned to it; if no job number is assigned it shall become a background command but not a background job.

A job-control background job can be controlled as described in 2.11 Job Control.

The process ID associated with the asynchronous AND-OR list shall become known in the current shell execution environment; see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment. This process ID shall remain known until any one of the following occurs (and, unless otherwise specified, may continue to remain known after it occurs).

        The process terminates and the application waits for the process ID or the corresponding job ID (see wait).
        If the asynchronous AND-OR list did not become a background job: another asynchronous AND-OR list is invoked before "$!" (corresponding to the previous asynchronous AND-OR list) is expanded in the current shell execution environment.
        If the asynchronous AND-OR list became a background job: the jobs utility reports the termination status of that job.
        If the shell is interactive and the asynchronous AND-OR list became a background job: a message indicating completion of the corresponding job is written to standard error. If set -b is enabled, it is unspecified whether the process ID is removed from the list of known process IDs when the message is written or immediately prior to when the shell writes the next prompt for input.

The implementation need not retain more than the {CHILD_MAX} most recent entries in its list of known process IDs in the current shell execution environment.

If, and only if, job control is disabled, the standard input for the subshell in which an asynchronous AND-OR list is executed shall initially be assigned to an open file description that behaves as if /dev/null had been opened for reading only. This initial assignment shall be overridden by any explicit redirection of standard input within the AND-OR list.

If the shell is interactive and the asynchronous AND-OR list became a background job, the job number and the process ID associated with the job shall be written to standard error using the format:

"[%d] %d\n", , 

If the shell is interactive and the asynchronous AND-OR list did not become a background job, the process ID associated with the asynchronous AND-OR list shall be written to standard error in an unspecified format.
Exit Status

The exit status of an asynchronous AND-OR list shall be zero.

The exit status of the subshell in which the AND-OR list is asynchronously executed can be obtained using the wait utility.
1.9.3.2 Sequential AND-OR Lists

AND-OR lists that are separated by a  (';') shall be executed sequentially. The format for executing AND-OR lists sequentially shall be:

aolist1 [; aolist2] ...

Each AND-OR list shall be expanded and executed in the order specified.

If job control is enabled, the AND-OR lists shall form all or part of a foreground job that can be controlled as described in 2.11 Job Control.
Exit Status

The exit status of a sequential AND-OR list shall be the exit status of the last pipeline in the AND-OR list that is executed.
1.9.3.3 AND Lists

The control operator "&&" denotes an AND list. The format shall be:

command1 [ && command2] ...

First command1 shall be executed. If its exit status is zero, command2 shall be executed, and so on, until a command has a non-zero exit status or there are no more commands left to execute. The commands are expanded only if they are executed.
Exit Status

The exit status of an AND list shall be the exit status of the last command that is executed in the list.
1.9.3.4 OR Lists

The control operator "||" denotes an OR List. The format shall be:

command1 [ || command2] ...

First, command1 shall be executed. If its exit status is non-zero, command2 shall be executed, and so on, until a command has a zero exit status or there are no more commands left to execute.
Exit Status

The exit status of an OR list shall be the exit status of the last command that is executed in the list.
1.9.4 Compound Commands

The shell has several programming constructs that are "compound commands", which provide control flow for commands. Each of these compound commands has a reserved word or control operator at the beginning, and a corresponding terminator reserved word or operator at the end. In addition, each can be followed by redirections on the same line as the terminator. Each redirection shall apply to all the commands within the compound command that do not explicitly override that redirection.

In the descriptions below, the exit status of some compound commands is stated in terms of the exit status of a compound-list. The exit status of a compound-list shall be the value that the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters) would have immediately after execution of the compound-list.
1.9.4.1 Grouping Commands

The format for grouping commands is as follows:

( compound-list )
        Execute compound-list in a subshell environment; see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment. Variable assignments and built-in commands that affect the environment shall not remain in effect after the list finishes.

        If a character sequence beginning with "((" would be parsed by the shell as an arithmetic expansion if preceded by a '$', shells which implement an extension whereby "((expression))" is evaluated as an arithmetic expression may treat the "((" as introducing as an arithmetic evaluation instead of a grouping command. A conforming application shall ensure that it separates the two leading '(' characters with white space to prevent the shell from performing an arithmetic evaluation.
{ compound-list ; }
        Execute compound-list in the current process environment. The semicolon shown here is an example of a control operator delimiting the } reserved word. Other delimiters are possible, as shown in 2.10 Shell Grammar; a  is frequently used.

Exit Status

The exit status of a grouping command shall be the exit status of compound-list.
1.9.4.2 The for Loop

The for loop shall execute a sequence of commands for each member in a list of items. The for loop requires that the reserved words do and done be used to delimit the sequence of commands.

The format for the for loop is as follows:

for name [ in [word ... ]]
do
        compound-list
done

First, the list of words following in shall be expanded to generate a list of items. Then, the variable name shall be set to each item, in turn, and the compound-list executed each time. If no items result from the expansion, the compound-list shall not be executed. Omitting:

in word ...

shall be equivalent to:

in "$@"

Exit Status

If there is at least one item in the list of items, the exit status of a for command shall be the exit status of the last compound-list executed. If there are no items, the exit status shall be zero.
1.9.4.3 Case Conditional Construct

The conditional construct case shall execute the compound-list corresponding to the first pattern (see 2.14 Pattern Matching Notation), if any are present, that is matched by the string resulting from the tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal of the given word. The reserved word in shall denote the beginning of the patterns to be matched. Multiple patterns with the same compound-list shall be delimited by the '|' symbol. The control operator ')' terminates a list of patterns corresponding to a given action. The terminated pattern list and the following compound-list is called a case statement clause. Each case statement clause, with the possible exception of the last, shall be terminated with either ";;" or ";&". The case construct terminates with the reserved word esac (case reversed).

The format for the case construct is as follows:

case word in
        [[(] pattern[ | pattern] ... ) compound-list terminator] ...
        [[(] pattern[ | pattern] ... ) compound-list]
esac

Where terminator is either ";;" or ";&" and is optional for the last compound-list.

In order from the beginning to the end of the case statement, each pattern that labels a compound-list shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, and the result of these expansions shall be compared against the expansion of word, according to the rules described in 2.14 Pattern Matching Notation (which also describes the effect of quoting parts of the pattern). After the first match, no more patterns in the case statement shall be expanded, and the compound-list of the matching clause shall be executed. If the case statement clause is terminated by ";;", no further clauses shall be examined. If the case statement clause is terminated by ";&", then the compound-list (if any) of each subsequent clause shall be executed, in order, until either a clause terminated by ";;" is reached and its compound-list (if any) executed or there are no further clauses in the case statement. The order of expansion and comparison of multiple patterns that label a compound-list statement is unspecified.
Exit Status

The exit status of case shall be zero if no patterns are matched. Otherwise, the exit status shall be the exit status of the compound-list of the last clause to be executed.
1.9.4.4 The if Conditional Construct

The if command shall execute a compound-list and use its exit status to determine whether to execute another compound-list.

The format for the if construct is as follows:

if compound-list
then
        compound-list
[elif compound-list
then
        compound-list] ...
[else
        compound-list]
fi

The if compound-list shall be executed; if its exit status is zero, the then compound-list shall be executed and the command shall complete. Otherwise, each elif compound-list shall be executed, in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the then compound-list shall be executed and the command shall complete. Otherwise, the else compound-list shall be executed.
Exit Status

The exit status of the if command shall be the exit status of the then or else compound-list that was executed, or zero, if none was executed.

Note:
        Although the exit status of the if or elif compound-list is ignored when determining the exit status of the if command, it is available through the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters) during execution of the next then, elif, or else compound-list (if any is executed) in the normal way.

1.9.4.5 The while Loop

The while loop shall continuously execute one compound-list as long as another compound-list has a zero exit status.

The format of the while loop is as follows:

while compound-list-1
do
        compound-list-2
done

The compound-list-1 shall be executed, and if it has a non-zero exit status, the while command shall complete. Otherwise, the compound-list-2 shall be executed, and the process shall repeat.
Exit Status

The exit status of the while loop shall be the exit status of the last compound-list-2 executed, or zero if none was executed.

Note:
        Since the exit status of compound-list-1 is ignored when determining the exit status of the while command, it is not possible to obtain the status of the command that caused the loop to exit, other than via the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters) during execution of compound-list-1, for example:

        while some_command; st=$?; false; do ...

        The exit status of compound-list-1 is available through the special parameter '?' during execution of compound-list-2, but is known to be zero at that point anyway.

1.9.4.6 The until Loop

The until loop shall continuously execute one compound-list as long as another compound-list has a non-zero exit status.

The format of the until loop is as follows:

until compound-list-1
do
        compound-list-2
done

The compound-list-1 shall be executed, and if it has a zero exit status, the until command completes. Otherwise, the compound-list-2 shall be executed, and the process repeats.
Exit Status

The exit status of the until loop shall be the exit status of the last compound-list-2 executed, or zero if none was executed.

Note:
        Although the exit status of compound-list-1 is ignored when determining the exit status of the until command, it is available through the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters) during execution of compound-list-2 in the normal way.

1.9.5 Function Definition Command

A function is a user-defined name that is used as a simple command to call a compound command with new positional parameters. A function is defined with a "function definition command".

The format of a function definition command is as follows:

fname ( ) compound-command [io-redirect ...]

The function is named fname; the application shall ensure that it is a name (see XBD 3.216 Name) and that it is not the name of a special built-in utility. An implementation may allow other characters in a function name as an extension. The implementation shall maintain separate name spaces for functions and variables.

The argument compound-command represents a compound command, as described in 2.9.4 Compound Commands.

When the function is declared, none of the expansions in 2.6 Word Expansions shall be performed on the text in compound-command or io-redirect; all expansions shall be performed as normal each time the function is called. Similarly, the optional io-redirect redirections and any variable assignments within compound-command shall be performed during the execution of the function itself, not the function definition. See 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of failures of these operations on interactive and non-interactive shells.

When a function is executed, it shall have the syntax-error properties described for special built-in utilities in the first item in the enumerated list at the beginning of 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities.

The compound-command shall be executed whenever the function name is specified as the name of a simple command (see 2.9.1.4 Command Search and Execution). The operands to the command temporarily shall become the positional parameters during the execution of the compound-command; the special parameter '#' also shall be changed to reflect the number of operands. The special parameter 0 shall be unchanged. When the function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter '#' shall be restored to the values they had before the function was executed. If the special built-in return (see return) is executed in the compound-command, the function completes and execution shall resume with the next command after the function call.
Exit Status

The exit status of a function definition shall be zero if the function was declared successfully; otherwise, it shall be greater than zero. The exit status of a function invocation shall be the exit status of the last command executed by the function.
1.10 Shell Grammar

The following grammar defines the Shell Command Language. This formal syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax description.
1.10.1 Shell Grammar Lexical Conventions

The input language to the shell shall be first recognized at the character level. The resulting tokens shall be classified by their immediate context according to the following rules (applied in order). These rules shall be used to determine what a "token" is that is subject to parsing at the token level. The rules for token recognition in 2.3 Token Recognition shall apply.

        If the token is an operator, the token identifier for that operator shall result.
        If the string consists solely of digits and the delimiter character is one of '', the token identifier IO_NUMBER shall result.
        If the string contains at least three characters, begins with a  ('{') and ends with a  ('}'), and the delimiter character is one of '', the token identifier IO_LOCATION may result; if the result is not IO_LOCATION, the token identifier TOKEN shall result.
        Otherwise, the token identifier TOKEN shall result.

Further distinction on TOKEN is context-dependent. It may be that the same TOKEN yields WORD, a NAME, an ASSIGNMENT_WORD, or one of the reserved words below, dependent upon the context. Some of the productions in the grammar below are annotated with a rule number from the following list. When a TOKEN is seen where one of those annotated productions could be used to reduce the symbol, the applicable rule shall be applied to convert the token identifier type of the TOKEN to:

        The token identifier of the recognized reserved word, for rule 1
        A token identifier acceptable at that point in the grammar, for all other rules

The reduction shall then proceed based upon the token identifier type yielded by the rule applied. When more than one rule applies, the highest numbered rule shall apply (which in turn may refer to another rule). (Note that except in rule 7, the presence of an '=' in the token has no effect.)

The WORD tokens shall have the word expansion rules applied to them immediately before the associated command is executed, not at the time the command is parsed.
1.10.2 Shell Grammar Rules

        [Command Name]

        When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned. Also, if the parser is in any state where only a reserved word could be the next correct token, proceed as above.

        Note:
            Because at this point quoting characters (, single-quote, , and the  single-quote sequence) are retained in the token, quoted strings cannot be recognized as reserved words. This rule also implies that reserved words are not recognized except in certain positions in the input, such as after a  or ; the grammar presumes that if the reserved word is intended, it is properly delimited by the user, and does not attempt to reflect that requirement directly. Also note that line joining is done before tokenization, as described in 2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash), so escaped  characters are already removed at this point.

        Rule 1 is not directly referenced in the grammar, but is referred to by other rules, or applies globally.
        [Redirection to or from filename]

        The expansions specified in 2.7 Redirection shall occur. As specified there, exactly one field can result (or the result is unspecified), and there are additional requirements on pathname expansion.
        [Redirection from here-document]

        Quote removal shall be applied to the word to determine the delimiter that is used to find the end of the here-document that begins after the next .
        [Case statement termination]

        When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word esac, the token identifier for esac shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.
        [NAME in for]

        When the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name (see XBD 3.216 Name), the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.
        [Third word of for and case]
            [case only]

            When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in, the token identifier for in shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.
            [for only]

            When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in or do, the token identifier for in or do shall result, respectively. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

        (For a. and b.: As indicated in the grammar, a linebreak precedes the tokens in and do. If  characters are present at the indicated location, it is the token after them that is treated in this fashion.)
        [Assignment preceding command name]
            [When the first word]

            If the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, 7b shall be applied.
            [Not the first word]

            If the TOKEN contains an unquoted (as determined while applying rule 4 from 2.3 Token Recognition)  character that is not part of an embedded parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion construct (as determined while applying rule 5 from 2.3 Token Recognition):
                If the TOKEN begins with '=', then the token WORD shall be returned.
                If all the characters in the TOKEN preceding the first such  form a valid name (see XBD 3.216 Name), the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned.
                Otherwise, it is implementation-defined whether the token WORD or ASSIGNMENT_WORD is returned, or the TOKEN is processed in some other way.

            Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

        If a returned ASSIGNMENT_WORD token begins with a valid name, assignment of the value after the first  to the name shall occur as specified in 2.9.1 Simple Commands. If a returned ASSIGNMENT_WORD token does not begin with a valid name, the way in which the token is processed is unspecified.
        [NAME in function]

        When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, when the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name, the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, rule 7 applies.
        [Body of function]

        Word expansion and assignment shall never occur, even when required by the rules above, when this rule is being parsed. Each TOKEN that might either be expanded or have assignment applied to it shall instead be returned as a single WORD consisting only of characters that are exactly the token described in 2.3 Token Recognition .

1.11 Job Control

Job control is defined (see XBD 3.181 Job Control) as a facility that allows users selectively to stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point. It is jointly supplied by the terminal I/O driver and a command interpreter. The shell is one such command interpreter and job control in the shell is enabled by set -m (which is enabled by default in interactive shells). The remainder of this section describes the job control facility provided by the shell. Requirements relating to background jobs stated in this section only apply to job-control background jobs.

If the shell has a controlling terminal and it is the controlling process for the terminal session, it shall initially set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to its own process group ID. Otherwise, if it has a controlling terminal, it shall initially perform the following steps if interactive and may perform them if non-interactive:

        If its process group is the foreground process group associated with the terminal, the shell shall set its process group ID to its process ID (if they are not already equal) and set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to its process group ID.
        If its process group is not the foreground process group associated with the terminal (which would result from it being started by a job-control shell as a background job), the shell shall either stop itself by sending itself a SIGTTIN signal or, if interactive, attempt to read from standard input (which generates a SIGTTIN signal if standard input is the controlling terminal). If it is stopped, then when it continues execution (after receiving a SIGCONT signal) it shall repeat these steps.

Subsequently, the shell shall change the foreground process group associated with its controlling terminal when a foreground job is running as noted in the description below.

When job control is enabled, the shell shall create one or more jobs when it executes a list (see 2.9.3 Lists) that has one of the following forms:

        A single asynchronous AND-OR list
        One or more sequentially executed AND-OR lists followed by at most one asynchronous AND-OR list

For the purposes of job control, a list that includes more than one asynchronous AND-OR list shall be treated as if it were split into multiple separate lists, each ending with an asynchronous AND-OR list.

When a job consisting of a single asynchronous AND-OR list is created, it shall form a background job and the associated process ID shall be that of a child process that is made a process group leader, with all other processes (if any) that the shell creates to execute the AND-OR list initially having this process ID as their process group ID.

For a list consisting of one or more sequentially executed AND-OR lists followed by at most one asynchronous AND-OR list, the whole list shall form a single foreground job up until the sequentially executed AND-OR lists have all completed execution, at which point the asynchronous AND-OR list (if any) shall form a background job as described above.

For each pipeline in a foreground job, if the pipeline is executed while the list is still a foreground job, the set of processes comprising the pipeline, and any processes descended from it, shall all be in the same process group, unless the shell executes some of the commands in the pipeline in the current shell execution environment and others in a subshell environment; in this case the process group ID of the current shell need not change (or cannot change if it is the session leader), and consequently the process group ID that the other processes all share may differ from the process group ID of the current shell (which means that a SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU signal sent to one of those process groups does not cause the whole pipeline to stop).

A background job that was created on execution of an asynchronous AND-OR list can be brought into the foreground by means of the fg utility (if supported); in this case the entire job shall become a single foreground job. If a process that the shell subsequently waits for is part of this foreground job and is stopped by a signal, the entire job shall become a suspended job and the behavior shall be as if the process had been stopped while the job was running in the background.

When a foreground job is created, or a background job is brought into the foreground by the fg utility, if the shell has a controlling terminal it shall set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal as follows:

        If the job was originally created as a background job, the foreground process group ID shall be set to the process ID of the process that the shell made a process group leader when it executed the asynchronous AND-OR list.
        If the job was originally created as a foreground job, the foreground process group ID shall be set as follows when each pipeline in the job is executed:
            If the shell is not itself executing, in the current shell execution environment, all of the commands in the pipeline, the foreground process group ID shall be set to the process group ID that is shared by the other processes executing the pipeline (see above).
            If all of the commands in the pipeline are being executed by the shell itself in the current shell execution environment, the foreground process group ID shall be set to the process group ID of the shell.

When a foreground job terminates, or becomes a suspended job (see below), if the shell has a controlling terminal it shall set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to the process group ID of the shell.

Each background job (whether suspended or not) shall have associated with it a job number and a process ID that is known in the current shell execution environment. When a background job is brought into the foreground by means of the fg utility, the associated job number shall be removed from the shell's background jobs list and the associated process ID shall be removed from the list of process IDs known in the current shell execution environment.

If a process that the shell is waiting for is part of a foreground job that was started as a foreground job and is stopped by a catchable signal (SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU):

        If the currently executing AND-OR list within the list comprising the foreground job consists of a single pipeline in which all of the commands are simple commands, the shell shall either create a suspended job consisting of at least that AND-OR list and the remaining (if any) AND-OR lists in the same list, or create a suspended job consisting of just that AND-OR list and discard the remaining (if any) AND-OR lists in the same list.
        Otherwise, the shell shall create a suspended job consisting of a set of commands, from within the list comprising the foreground job, that is unspecified except that the set shall include at least the pipeline to which the stopped process belongs. Commands in the foreground job that have not already completed and are not included in the suspended job shall be discarded.

Note:
        Although only a pipeline of simple commands is guaranteed to remain intact if started in the foreground and subsequently suspended, it is possible to ensure that a complex AND-OR list will remain intact when suspended by starting it in the background and immediately bringing it into the foreground. For example:

        command1 && command2 | { command3 || command4; } & fg

If a process that the shell is waiting for is part of a foreground job that was started as a foreground job and is stopped by a SIGSTOP signal, the behavior shall be as described above for a catchable signal unless the shell was executing a built-in utility in the current shell execution environment when the SIGSTOP was delivered, resulting in the shell itself being stopped by the signal, in which case if the shell subsequently receives a SIGCONT signal and has one or more child processes that remain stopped, the shell shall create a suspended job as if only those child processes had been stopped.

When a suspended job is created as a result of a foreground job being stopped, it shall be assigned a job number, and an interactive shell shall write, and a non-interactive shell may write, a message to standard error, formatted as described by the jobs utility (without the -l option) for a suspended job. The message may indicate that the commands comprising the job include commands that have already completed; in this case the completed commands shall not be repeated if execution of the job is subsequently continued. If the shell is interactive, it shall save the terminal settings before changing them to the settings it needs to read further commands.

When a process associated with a background job is stopped by a SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU signal, the shell shall convert the (non-suspended) background job into a suspended job and an interactive shell shall write a message to standard error, formatted as described by the jobs utility (without the -l option) for a suspended job, at the following time:

        If set -b is enabled, the message shall be written either immediately after the job became suspended or immediately prior to writing the next prompt for input.
        If set -b is disabled, the message shall be written immediately prior to writing the next prompt for input.

Execution of a suspended job can be continued as a foreground job by means of the fg utility (if supported), or as a (non-suspended) background job either by means of the bg utility (if supported) or by sending the stopped processes a SIGCONT signal. The fg and bg utilities shall send a SIGCONT signal to the process group of the process(es) whose stopped wait status caused the shell to suspend the job. If the shell has a controlling terminal, the fg utility shall send the SIGCONT signal after it has set the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal (see above). If the fg utility is used from an interactive shell to bring into the foreground a suspended job that was created from a foreground job, before it sends the SIGCONT signal the fg utility shall restore the terminal settings to the ones that the shell saved when the job was suspended.

When a background job completes or is terminated by a signal, an interactive shell shall write a message to standard error, formatted as described by the jobs utility (without the -l option) for a job that completed or was terminated by a signal, respectively, at the following time:

        If set -b is enabled, the message shall be written immediately after the job completes or is terminated.
        If set -b is disabled, the message shall be written immediately prior to writing the next prompt for input.

In each case above where an interactive shell writes a message immediately prior to writing the next prompt for input, the same message may also be written by a non-interactive shell, at any of the following times:

        After the next time a foreground job terminates or is suspended
        Before the shell parses further input
        Before the shell exits

1.12 Signals and Error Handling

If job control is disabled (see the description of set -m) when the shell executes an asynchronous AND-OR list, the commands in the list shall inherit from the shell a signal action of ignored (SIG_IGN) for the SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals. In all other cases, commands executed by the shell shall inherit the same signal actions as those inherited by the shell from its parent unless a signal action is modified by the trap special built-in (see trap)

When a signal for which a trap has been set is received while the shell is waiting for the completion of a utility executing a foreground command, the trap associated with that signal shall not be executed until after the foreground command has completed. When the shell is waiting, by means of the wait utility, for asynchronous commands to complete, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set shall cause the wait utility to return immediately with an exit status >128, immediately after which the trap associated with that signal shall be taken.

If multiple signals are pending for the shell for which there are associated trap actions, the order of execution of trap actions is unspecified.
1.13 Shell Execution Environment

A shell execution environment consists of the following:

        Open files inherited upon invocation of the shell, plus open files controlled by exec
        Working directory as set by cd
        File creation mask set by umask
        File size limit as set by ulimit
        Current traps set by trap
        Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment (see the set special built-in) or from the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 environment inherited by the shell when it begins (see the export special built-in)
        Shell functions; see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command
        Options turned on at invocation or by set
        Background jobs and their associated process IDs, and process IDs of child processes created to execute asynchronous AND-OR lists while job control is disabled; together these process IDs constitute the process IDs "known to this shell environment". If the implementation supports non-job-control background jobs, the list of known process IDs and the list of background jobs may form a single list even though this standard describes them as being updated separately. See 2.9.3.1 Asynchronous AND-OR Lists
        Shell aliases; see 2.3.1 Alias Substitution

Utilities other than the special built-ins (see 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities) shall be invoked in a separate environment that consists of the following. The initial value of these objects shall be the same as that for the parent shell, except as noted below.

        Open files inherited on invocation of the shell, open files controlled by the exec special built-in plus any modifications, and additions specified by any redirections to the utility
        Current working directory
        File creation mask
        If the utility is a shell script, traps caught by the shell shall be set to the default values and traps ignored by the shell shall be set to be ignored by the utility; if the utility is not a shell script, the trap actions (default or ignore) shall be mapped into the appropriate signal handling actions for the utility
        Variables with the export attribute, along with those explicitly exported for the duration of the command, shall be passed to the utility environment variables
        It is unspecified whether environment variables that were passed to the invoking shell when it was invoked itself, but were not used to initialize shell variables (see 2.5.3 Shell Variables) because they had invalid names, are included in the invoked utility's environment.

The environment of the shell process shall not be changed by the utility unless explicitly specified by the utility description (for example, cd and umask).

A subshell environment shall be created as a duplicate of the shell environment, except that:

        Unless specified otherwise (see trap), traps that are not being ignored shall be set to the default action.
        If the shell is interactive, the subshell shall behave as a non-interactive shell in all respects except:
            The expansion of the special parameter '-' may continue to indicate that it is interactive.
            The set -n option may be ignored.

Changes made to the subshell environment shall not affect the shell environment. Command substitution, commands that are grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous AND-OR lists shall be executed in a subshell environment. Additionally, each command of a multi-command pipeline is in a subshell environment; as an extension, however, any or all commands in a pipeline may be executed in the current environment. Except where otherwise stated, all other commands shall be executed in the current shell environment.
1.14 Pattern Matching Notation

The pattern matching notation described in this section is used to specify patterns for matching character strings in the shell. This notation is also used by some other utilities (find, pax, and optionally make) and by some system interfaces (fnmatch(), glob(), and wordexp()). Historically, pattern matching notation is related to, but slightly different from, the regular expression notation described in XBD 9. Regular Expressions. For this reason, the description of the rules for this pattern matching notation are based on the description of regular expression notation, modified to account for the differences.

If an attempt is made to use pattern matching notation to match a string that contains one or more bytes that do not form part of a valid character, the behavior is unspecified. Since pathnames can contain such bytes, portable applications need to ensure that the current locale is the C or POSIX locale when performing pattern matching (or expansion) on arbitrary pathnames.
1.14.1 Patterns Matching a Single Character

The following patterns shall match a single character: ordinary characters, special pattern characters, and pattern bracket expressions. The pattern bracket expression also shall match a single collating element.

In a pattern, or part of one, where a shell-quoting  can be used, a  character shall escape the following character as described in 2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash), regardless of whether or not the  is inside a bracket expression. (The sequence "\\" represents one literal .)

In a pattern, or part of one, where a shell-quoting  cannot be used to preserve the literal value of a character that would otherwise be treated as special:

        A  character that is not inside a bracket expression shall preserve the literal value of the following character, unless the following character is in a part of the pattern where shell quoting can be used and is a shell quoting character, in which case the behavior is unspecified.
        For the shell only, it is unspecified whether or not a  character inside a bracket expression preserves the literal value of the following character.

All of the requirements and effects of quoting on ordinary, shell special, and special pattern characters shall apply to escaping in this context, except where specified otherwise. (Situations where this applies include word expansions when a pattern used in pathname expansion is not present in the original word but results from an earlier expansion, or the argument to the find -name or -path primary as passed to find, or the pattern argument to the fnmatch() and glob() functions when FNM_NOESCAPE or GLOB_NOESCAPE is not set in flags, respectively.)

If a pattern ends with an unescaped , the behavior is unspecified.

An ordinary character is a pattern that shall match itself. In a pattern, or part of one, where a shell-quoting  can be used, an ordinary character can be any character in the supported character set except for NUL, those special shell characters in 2.2 Quoting that require quoting, and the three special pattern characters described below. In a pattern, or part of one, where a shell-quoting  cannot be used to preserve the literal value of a character that would otherwise be treated as special, an ordinary character can be any character in the supported character set except for NUL and the three special pattern characters described below. Matching shall be based on the bit pattern used for encoding the character, not on the graphic representation of the character. If any character (ordinary, shell special, or pattern special) is quoted, or escaped with a , that pattern shall match the character itself. The application shall ensure that it quotes or escapes any character that would otherwise be treated as special, in order for it to be matched as an ordinary character.

When unquoted, unescaped, and not inside a bracket expression, the following three characters shall have special meaning in the specification of patterns:

?
        A  is a pattern that shall match any character.
*
        An  is a pattern that shall match multiple characters, as described in 2.14.2 Patterns Matching Multiple Characters.
[
        A  shall introduce a bracket expression if the characters following it meet the requirements for bracket expressions stated in XBD 9.3.5 RE Bracket Expression, except that the  character ('!') shall replace the  character ('^') in its role in a non-matching list in the regular expression notation. A bracket expression starting with an unquoted  character produces unspecified results. A  that does not introduce a valid bracket expression shall match the character itself.

1.14.2 Patterns Matching Multiple Characters

The following rules are used to construct patterns matching multiple characters from patterns matching a single character:

        The  ('*') is a pattern that shall match any string, including the null string.
        The concatenation of patterns matching a single character is a valid pattern that shall match the concatenation of the single characters or collating elements matched by each of the concatenated patterns.
        The concatenation of one or more patterns matching a single character with one or more  characters is a valid pattern. In such patterns, each  shall match a string of zero or more characters, matching the greatest possible number of characters that still allows the remainder of the pattern to match the string.

1.14.3 Patterns Used for Filename Expansion

The rules described so far in 2.14.1 Patterns Matching a Single Character and 2.14.2 Patterns Matching Multiple Characters are qualified by the following rules that apply when pattern matching notation is used for filename expansion:

        The  character in a pathname shall be explicitly matched by using one or more  characters in the pattern; it shall neither be matched by the  or  special characters nor by a bracket expression.  characters in the pattern shall be identified before bracket expressions; thus, a  cannot be included in a pattern bracket expression used for filename expansion. If a  character is found following an unescaped  character before a corresponding  is found, the open bracket shall be treated as an ordinary character. For example, the pattern "a[b/c]d" does not match such pathnames as abd or a/d. It only matches a pathname of literally a[b/c]d.
        If a filename begins with a  ('.'), the  shall be explicitly matched by using a  as the first character of the pattern or immediately following a  character. The leading  shall not be matched by:
            The  or  special characters
            A bracket expression containing a non-matching list, such as "[!a]", a range expression, such as "[%-0]", or a character class expression, such as "[[:punct:]]"

        It is unspecified whether an explicit  in a bracket expression matching list, such as "[.abc]", can match a leading  in a filename.
        If a specified pattern contains any '*', '?' or '[' characters that will be treated as special (see 2.14.1 Patterns Matching a Single Character), it shall be matched against existing filenames and pathnames, as appropriate; if directory entries for dot and dot-dot exist, they may be ignored. Each component that contains any such characters shall require read permission in the directory containing that component. Each component that contains a  that will be treated as special may require read permission in the directory containing that component. Any component, except the last, that does not contain any '*', '?' or '[' characters that will be treated as special shall require search permission. If these permissions are denied, or if an attempt to open or search a pathname as a directory, or an attempt to read an opened directory, fails because of an error condition that is related to file system contents, this shall not be considered an error and pathname expansion shall continue as if the pathname had named an existing directory which had been successfully opened and read, or searched, and no matching directory entries had been found in it. For other error conditions it is unspecified whether pathname expansion fails or they are treated the same as when permission is denied.

        For example, given the pattern:

        /foo/bar/x*/bam

        search permission is needed for directories / and foo, search and read permissions are needed for directory bar, and search permission is needed for each x* directory.

        If the pattern matches any existing filenames or pathnames, the pattern shall be replaced with those filenames and pathnames, sorted according to the collating sequence in effect in the current locale. If this collating sequence does not have a total ordering of all characters (see XBD 7.3.2 LC_COLLATE), any filenames or pathnames that collate equally shall be further compared byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

        If the pattern contains an open bracket ('[') that does not introduce a bracket expression as in XBD 9.3.5 RE Bracket Expression, it is unspecified whether other unquoted '*', '?', '[' or  characters within the same slash-delimited component of the pattern retain their special meanings or are treated as ordinary characters. For example, the pattern "a*[/b*" may match all filenames beginning with 'b' in the directory "a*[" or it may match all filenames beginning with 'b' in all directories with names beginning with 'a' and ending with '['.

        If the pattern does not match any existing filenames or pathnames, the pattern string shall be left unchanged.

        Note:
            A future version of this standard may require that directory entries for dot and dot-dot are ignored (if they exist) when matching patterns against existing filenames. For example, when expanding the pattern ".*" the result would not include dot and dot-dot.

        If a specified pattern does not contain any '*', '?' or '[' characters that will be treated as special, the pattern string shall be left unchanged.

1.15 Special Built-In Utilities

The following "special built-in" utilities shall be supported in the shell command language. The output of each command, if any, shall be written to standard output, subject to the normal redirection and piping possible with all commands.

The term "built-in" implies that there is no need to execute a separate executable file because the utility is implemented in the shell itself. An implementation may choose to make any utility a built-in; however, the special built-in utilities described here differ from regular built-in utilities in two respects:

        An error in a special built-in utility may cause a shell executing that utility to abort, while an error in a regular built-in utility shall not cause a shell executing that utility to abort. (See 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of errors on interactive and non-interactive shells.) If a special built-in utility encountering an error does not abort the shell, its exit value shall be non-zero.
        As described in 2.9.1 Simple Commands, variable assignments preceding the invocation of a special built-in utility affect the current execution environment; this shall not be the case with a regular built-in or other utility.

The special built-in utilities in this section need not be provided in a manner accessible via the exec family of functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024.

Some of the special built-ins are described as conforming to XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines. For those that are not, the requirement in 1.4 Utility Description Defaults that "--" be recognized as a first argument to be discarded does not apply and a conforming application shall not use that argument.

##  

## NAME

        break — exit from for, while, or until loop


## SYNOPSIS

        break [n]


## DESCRIPTION

        If n is specified, the break utility shall exit from the nth enclosing for, while, or until loop. If n is not specified, break shall behave as if n was specified as 1. Execution shall continue with the command immediately following the exited loop. The application shall ensure that the value of n is a positive decimal integer. If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be exited. If there is no enclosing loop, the behavior is unspecified.

        A loop shall enclose a break or continue command if the loop lexically encloses the command. A loop lexically encloses a break or continue command if the command is:

            Executing in the same execution environment (see 2.13 Shell Execution Environment) as the compound-list of the loop's do-group (see 2.10.2 Shell Grammar Rules), and
            Contained in a compound-list associated with the loop (either in the compound-list of the loop's do-group or, if the loop is a while or until loop, in the compound-list following the while or until reserved word), and
            Not in the body of a function whose function definition command (see 2.9.5 Function Definition Command) is contained in a compound-list associated with the loop.

        If n is greater than the number of lexically enclosing loops and there is a non-lexically enclosing loop in progress in the same execution environment as the break or continue command, it is unspecified whether that loop encloses the command.


## OPTIONS

        None.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

         0
            Successful completion.
        >0
            The n value was not an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        None.


## EXAMPLES

        for i in *
        do
            if test -d "$i"
            then break
            fi
        done

        The results of running the following example are unspecified: there are two loops in progress when the break command is executed, and they are in the same execution environment, but neither loop is lexically enclosing the break command. (There are no loops lexically enclosing the continue commands, either.)

        foo() {
            for j in 1 2; do
                echo 'break 2' >/tmp/do_break
                echo "  sourcing /tmp/do_break ($j)..."
                # the behavior of the break from running the following command
                # results in unspecified behavior:
                . /tmp/do_break

                do_continue() { continue 2; }
                echo "  running do_continue ($j)..."
                # the behavior of the continue in the following function call
                # results in unspecified behavior (if execution reaches this
                # point):
                do_continue

                trap 'continue 2' USR1
                echo "  sending SIGUSR1 to self ($j)..."
                # the behavior of the continue in the trap invoked from the
                # following signal results in unspecified behavior (if
                # execution reaches this point):
                kill -s USR1 $$
                sleep 1
            done
        }
        for i in 1 2; do
            echo "running foo ($i)..."
            foo
        done


## RATIONALE

        In early proposals, consideration was given to expanding the syntax of break and continue to refer to a label associated with the appropriate loop as a preferable alternative to the n method. However, this volume of POSIX.1-2024 does reserve the name space of command names ending with a . It is anticipated that a future implementation could take advantage of this and provide something like:

*utofloop: for i in a b c d e
        do
            for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
            do
                if test -r "${i}${j}"
                then break outofloop
                fi
            done
        done

        and that this might be standardized after implementation experience is achieved.

## NAME

        colon — null utility


## SYNOPSIS

        : [argument...]


## DESCRIPTION

        This utility shall do nothing except return a 0 exit status. It is used when a command is needed, as in the then condition of an if command, but nothing is to be done by the command.


## OPTIONS

        This utility shall not recognize the "--" argument in the manner specified by Guideline 10 of XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.

        Implementations shall not support any options.

        fi

        abc

        As with any of the special built-ins, the null utility can also have variable assignments and redirections associated with it, such as:

        x=y : > z

        which sets variable x to the value y (so that it persists after the null utility completes) and creates or truncates file z; if the file cannot be created or truncated, a non-interactive shell exits (see 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors).

## NAME

        continue — continue for, while, or until loop


## SYNOPSIS

        continue [n]


## DESCRIPTION

        If n is specified, the continue utility shall return to the top of the nth enclosing for, while, or until loop. If n is not specified, continue shall behave as if n was specified as 1. Returning to the top of the loop involves repeating the condition list of a while or until loop or performing the next assignment of a for loop, and re-executing the loop if appropriate.

        The application shall ensure that the value of n is a positive decimal integer. If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be used. If there is no enclosing loop, the behavior is unspecified.

        The meaning of "enclosing" shall be as specified in the description of the break utility.

## NAME

        dot — execute commands in the current environment


## SYNOPSIS

        . file


## DESCRIPTION

        The shell shall tokenize (see 2.3 Token Recognition) the contents of the file, parse the tokens (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), and execute the resulting commands in the current environment. It is unspecified whether the commands are parsed and executed as a program (as for a shell script) or are parsed as a single compound_list that is executed after the entire file has been parsed.

        If file does not contain a , the shell shall use the search path specified by PATH to find the directory containing file. Unlike normal command search, however, the file searched for by the dot utility need not be executable. If no readable file is found, a non-interactive shell shall abort; an interactive shell shall write a diagnostic message to standard error.

        The dot special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines, except for Guidelines 1 and 2.


## OPTIONS

        None.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.

## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

## EXIT STATUS

        If no readable file was found or if the commands in the file could not be parsed, and the shell is interactive (and therefore does not abort; see 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors), the exit status shall be non-zero. Otherwise, return the value of the last command executed, or a zero exit status if no command is executed.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        None.


## EXAMPLES

        cat foobar

        foo=hello bar=world

        . ./foobar
        echo $foo $bar

        hello world


## RATIONALE

        Some older implementations searched the current directory for the file, even if the value of PATH disallowed it. This behavior was omitted from this volume of POSIX.1-2024 due to concerns about introducing the susceptibility to trojan horses that the user might be trying to avoid by leaving dot out of PATH .

        The KornShell version of dot takes optional arguments that are set to the positional parameters. This is a valid extension that allows a dot script to behave identically to a function.

## NAME

        eval — construct command by concatenating arguments


## SYNOPSIS

        eval [argument...]


## DESCRIPTION

        The eval utility shall construct a command string by concatenating arguments together, separating each with a  character. The constructed command string shall be tokenized (see 2.3 Token Recognition), parsed (see 2.10 Shell Grammar), and executed by the shell in the current environment. It is unspecified whether the commands are parsed and executed as a program (as for a shell script) or are parsed as a single compound_list that is executed after the entire constructed command string has been parsed.


## OPTIONS

        None.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

## STDOUT

        Not used.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

        If there are no arguments, or only null arguments, eval shall return a zero exit status; otherwise, it shall return the exit status of the command defined by the string of concatenated arguments separated by  characters, or a non-zero exit status if the concatenation could not be parsed as a command and the shell is interactive (and therefore did not abort).


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        Since eval is not required to recognize the "--" end of options delimiter, in cases where the argument(s) to eval might begin with '-' it is recommended that the first argument is prefixed by a string that will not alter the commands to be executed, such as a  character:

        eval " $commands"

*r:

        eval " $(some_command)"


## EXAMPLES

        foo=10 x=foo
        y='$'$x
        echo $y

        $foo

        eval y='$'$x
        echo $y

        10


## RATIONALE

        This standard allows, but does not require, eval to recognize "--". Although this means applications cannot use "--" to protect against options supported as an extension (or errors reported for unsupported options), the nature of the eval utility is such that other means can be used to provide this protection (see APPLICATION USAGE above).

## NAME

        exec — perform redirections in the current shell or execute a utility


## SYNOPSIS

        exec [utility [argument...]]


## DESCRIPTION

        If exec is specified with no operands, any redirections associated with the exec command shall be made in the current shell execution environment. If any file descriptors with numbers greater than 2 are opened by those redirections, it is unspecified whether those file descriptors remain open when the shell invokes another utility. Scripts concerned that child shells could misuse open file descriptors can always close them explicitly, as shown in one of the following examples. If the result of the redirections would be that file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 is closed, implementations may open the file descriptor to an unspecified file.

        If exec is specified with a utility operand, the shell shall execute a non-built-in utility as described in 2.9.1.6 Non-built-in Utility Execution with utility as the command name and the argument operands (if any) as the command arguments.

        If the exec command fails, a non-interactive shell shall exit from the current shell execution environment; [UP] [Option Start]  an interactive shell may exit from a subshell environment but shall not exit if the current shell environment is not a subshell environment.

        If the exec command fails and the shell does not exit, any redirections associated with the exec command that were successfully made shall take effect in the current shell execution environment. [Option End]

        The exec special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.


## OPTIONS

        None.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        The following environment variable shall affect the execution of exec:


##     PATH
            Determine the search path when looking for the utility given as the utility operand; see XBD 8.3 Other Environment Variables.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

        Not used.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

        If utility is specified and is executed, exec shall not return to the shell; rather, the exit status of the current shell execution environment shall be the exit status of utility. If utility is specified and an attempt to execute it as a non-built-in utility fails, the exit status shall be as described in 2.9.1.6 Non-built-in Utility Execution. If a redirection error occurs (see 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors), the exit status shall be a value in the range 1-125. Otherwise, exec shall return a zero exit status.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        None.


## EXAMPLES

        Open readfile as file descriptor 3 for reading:

        exec 3< readfile

        Open writefile as file descriptor 4 for writing:

        exec 4> writefile

        Make file descriptor 5 a copy of file descriptor 0:

        exec 5<&0

        Close file descriptor 3:

        exec 3<&-

        Cat the file maggie by replacing the current shell with the cat utility:

        exec cat maggie

        An application that is not concerned with strict conformance can make use of optional %g support known to be present in the implementation's printf utility by ensuring that any shell built-in version is not executed instead, and using a subshell so that the shell continues afterwards:

        (exec printf '%g\n' "$float_value")


## RATIONALE

        Most historical implementations were not conformant in that:

        foo=bar exec cmd

        did not pass foo to cmd.

        None.

## NAME

        exit — cause the shell to exit


## SYNOPSIS

        exit [n]


## DESCRIPTION

        The exit utility shall cause the shell to exit from its current execution environment. If the current execution environment is a subshell environment, the shell shall exit from the subshell environment and continue in the environment from which that subshell environment was invoked; otherwise, the shell utility shall terminate. The wait status of the shell or subshell shall be determined by the unsigned decimal integer n, if specified.

        If n is specified and has a value between 0 and 255 inclusive, the wait status of the shell or subshell shall indicate that it exited with exit status n. If n is specified and has a value greater than 256 that corresponds to an exit status the shell assigns to commands terminated by a valid signal (see 2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands), the wait status of the shell or subshell shall indicate that it was terminated by that signal. No other actions associated with the signal, such as execution of trap actions or creation of a core image, shall be performed by the shell.

        If n is specified and is not an unsigned decimal integer, or has a value of 256, or has a value greater than 256 but not corresponding to an exit status the shell assigns to commands terminated by a valid signal, the wait status of the shell or subshell is unspecified.

        If n is not specified, the result shall be as if n were specified with the current value of the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters), except that if the exit command would cause the end of execution of a trap action, the value for the special parameter '?' that is considered "current" shall be the value it had immediately preceding the trap action.

        A trap action on EXIT shall be executed before the shell terminates, except when the exit utility is invoked in that trap action itself, in which case the shell shall exit immediately. It is unspecified whether setting a new trap action on EXIT during execution of a trap action on EXIT will cause the new trap action to be executed before the shell terminates.


## OPTIONS

        None.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

        The exit utility causes the shell to exit from its current execution environment, and therefore does not itself return an exit status.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        As explained in other sections, certain exit status values have been reserved for special uses and should be used by applications only for those purposes:

         126
            A file to be executed was found, but it was not an executable utility.
         127
            A utility to be executed was not found.
         128
            An unrecoverable read error was detected by the shell while reading commands, except from the file operand of the dot special built-in.
        >128
            A command was interrupted by a signal.


## EXAMPLES

        Exit with a true value:

        exit 0

        Exit with a false value:

        exit 1

        Propagate error handling from within a subshell:

        (
            command1 || exit 1
            command2 || exit 1
            exec command3
        ) > outputfile || exit 1
        echo "outputfile created successfully"


## RATIONALE

        The behavior of exit when given an invalid argument or unknown option is unspecified, because of differing practices in the various historical implementations. A value larger than 255 might be truncated by the shell, and be unavailable even to a parent process that uses waitid() to get the full exit value. It is recommended that implementations that detect any usage error should cause a non-zero exit status (or, if the shell is interactive and the error does not cause the shell to abort, store a non-zero value in "$?"), but even this was not done historically in all shells.

        See also C.2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands.

        None.

## NAME

        export — set the export attribute for variables


## SYNOPSIS

        export name[=word]...

##      
        export -p


## DESCRIPTION

        The shell shall give the export attribute to the variables corresponding to the specified names, which shall cause them to be in the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the name of a variable is followed by =word, then the value of that variable shall be set to word.

        The export special built-in shall be a declaration utility. Therefore, if export is recognized as the command name of a simple command, then subsequent words of the form name=word shall be expanded in an assignment context. See 2.9.1.1 Order of Processing.

        The export special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.

        When -p is specified, export shall write to the standard output the names and values of all exported variables, in the following format:

        "export %s=%s\n", , 

        if name is set, and:

        "export %s\n", 

        if name is unset.

        The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same exporting results, except:

            Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.
            Variables that were unset at the time they were output need not be reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the variable between the time the state was saved and the time at which the saved output is reinput to the shell.

        When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.


## OPTIONS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

         0
            Successful completion.
        >0
            At least one operand could not be processed as requested, such as a name operand that could not be exported or an attempt to modify a readonly variable using a name=word operand, or the -p option was specified and a write error occurred.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        Note that, unless X was previously marked readonly, the value of "$?" after:

        export X=$(false)

        will be 0 (because export successfully set X to the empty string) and that execution continues, even if set -e is in effect. In order to detect command substitution failures, a user must separate the assignment from the export, as in:

        X=$(false)
        export X

        In shells that support extended assignment syntax, for example to allow an array to be populated with a single assignment, such extensions can typically only be used in assignments specified as arguments to export if the command word is literally export, and not if it is some other word that expands to export. For example:

        # Shells that support array assignment as an extension generally
        # support this:
        export x=(1 2 3); echo ${x[0]}  # outputs 1
        # But generally do not support this:
        e=export; $e x=(1 2 3); echo ${x[0]}  # syntax error


## EXAMPLES

        Export PWD and HOME variables:

        export PWD HOME

        Set and export the PATH variable:

        export PATH="/local/bin:$PATH"

        Save and restore all exported variables:

        export -p > temp-file
        unset a lot of variables

        ... processing

        . ./temp-file

        Note:
            If LANG, LC_CTYPE or LC_ALL are left altered or unset in the above example prior to sourcing temp-file, the results may be undefined.


## RATIONALE

        Some historical shells use the no-argument case as the functional equivalent of what is required here with -p. This feature was left unspecified because it is not historical practice in all shells, and some scripts may rely on the now-unspecified results on their implementations. Attempts to specify the -p output as the default case were unsuccessful in achieving consensus. The -p option was added to allow portable access to the values that can be saved and then later restored using; for example, a dot script.

        Some implementations extend the shell's assignment syntax, for example to allow an array to be populated with a single assignment, and in order for such an extension to be usable in assignments specified as arguments to export these shells have export as a separate token in their grammar. This standard only permits an extension of this nature when the input to the shell would contain a syntax error according to the standard grammar. Note that although export can be a separate token in the shell's grammar, it cannot be a reserved word since export is a candidate for alias substitution whereas reserved words are not (see 2.3.1 Alias Substitution).

        None.

## NAME

        readonly — set the readonly attribute for variables


## SYNOPSIS

        readonly name[=word]...

##      
        readonly -p


## DESCRIPTION

        The variables whose names are specified shall be given the readonly attribute. The values of variables with the readonly attribute cannot be changed by subsequent assignment or use of the export, getopts, readonly, or read utilities, nor can those variables be unset by the unset utility. As described in XBD 8.1 Environment Variable Definition, conforming applications shall not request to mark a variable as readonly if it is documented as being manipulated by a shell built-in utility, as it may render those utilities unable to complete successfully. If the name of a variable is followed by =word, then the value of that variable shall be set to word.

        The readonly special built-in shall be a declaration utility. Therefore, if readonly is recognized as the command name of a simple command, then subsequent words of the form name=word shall be expanded in an assignment context. See 2.9.1.1 Order of Processing.

        The readonly special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.

        When -p is specified, readonly writes to the standard output the names and values of all read-only variables, in the following format:

        "readonly %s=%s\n", , 

        if name is set, and

        "readonly %s\n", 

        if name is unset.

        The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same value and readonly attribute-setting results in a shell execution environment in which:

            Variables with values at the time they were output do not have the readonly attribute set.
            Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not have a value at the time at which the saved output is reinput to the shell.

        When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

## EXIT STATUS

         0
            Successful completion.
        >0
            At least one operand could not be processed as requested, such as a name operand that could not be marked readonly or an attempt to modify an already readonly variable using a name=word operand, or the -p option was specified and a write error occurred.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        In shells that support extended assignment syntax, for example to allow an array to be populated with a single assignment, such extensions can typically only be used in assignments specified as arguments to readonly if the command word is literally readonly, and not if it is some other word that expands to readonly. For example:

        # Shells that support array assignment as an extension generally
        # support this:
        readonly x=(1 2 3); echo ${x[0]}  # outputs 1
        # But generally do not support this:
        r=readonly; $r x=(1 2 3); echo ${x[0]}  # syntax error


## EXAMPLES

        readonly HOME


## RATIONALE

        Some historical shells preserve the readonly attribute across separate invocations. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 allows this behavior, but does not require it.

        The -p option allows portable access to the values that can be saved and then later restored using, for example, a dot script. Also see the RATIONALE for export for a description of the no-argument and -p output cases and a related example.

        Read-only functions were considered, but they were omitted as not being historical practice or particularly useful. Furthermore, functions must not be read-only across invocations to preclude "spoofing" (spoofing is the term for the practice of creating a program that acts like a well-known utility with the intent of subverting the real intent of the user) of administrative or security-relevant (or security-conscious) shell scripts.

        Attempts to set the readonly attribute on certain variables, such as PWD , may have surprising results. Either readonly will reject the attempt, or the attempt will succeed but the shell will continue to alter the contents of PWD during the cd utility, or the attempt will succeed and render the cd utility inoperative (since it must not change directories if it cannot also update PWD ).

        Some implementations extend the shell's assignment syntax, for example to allow an array to be populated with a single assignment, and in order for such an extension to be usable in assignments specified as arguments to readonly these shells have readonly as a separate token in their grammar. This standard only permits an extension of this nature when the input to the shell would contain a syntax error according to the standard grammar. Note that although readonly can be a separate token in the shell's grammar, it cannot be a reserved word since readonly is a candidate for alias substitution whereas reserved words are not (see 2.3.1 Alias Substitution).

## NAME

        return — return from a function or dot script


## SYNOPSIS

        return [n]


## DESCRIPTION

        The return utility shall cause the shell to stop executing the current function or dot script. If the shell is not currently executing a function or dot script, the results are unspecified.


## OPTIONS

If n is not specified, the result shall be as if n were specified with the current value of the special parameter '?' (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters), except that if the return command would cause the end of execution of a trap action, the value for the special parameter '?' that is considered "current" shall be the value it had immediately preceding the trap action.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        None.


## EXAMPLES

## RATIONALE

        The behavior of return when not in a function or dot script differs between the System V shell and the KornShell. In the System V shell this is an error, whereas in the KornShell, the effect is the same as exit.

        The results of returning a number greater than 255 are undefined because of differing practices in the various historical implementations. Some shells AND out all but the low-order 8 bits; others allow larger values, but not of unlimited size.

## NAME

        set — set or unset options and positional parameters


## SYNOPSIS

        set [-abCefhmnuvx] [-o option] [argument...]

##      
        set [+abCefhmnuvx] [+o option] [argument...]

##      
        set -- [argument...]

##      
        set -o

##      
        set +o


## DESCRIPTION

        If no options or arguments are specified, set shall write the names and values of all shell variables in the collation sequence of the current locale. Each name shall start on a separate line, using the format:

        "%s=%s\n", , 

        The value string shall be written with appropriate quoting; see the description of shell quoting in 2.2 Quoting. The output shall be suitable for reinput to the shell, setting or resetting, as far as possible, the variables that are currently set; read-only variables cannot be reset.

        When options are specified, they shall set or unset attributes of the shell, as described below. When arguments are specified, they cause positional parameters to be set or unset, as described below. Setting or unsetting attributes and positional parameters are not necessarily related actions, but they can be combined in a single invocation of set.

        The set special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines except that options can be specified with either a leading  (meaning enable the option) or  (meaning disable it) unless otherwise specified.

        Implementations shall support the options in the following list in both their  and  forms. These options can also be specified as options to sh.

*a
            Set the export attribute for all variable assignments. When this option is on, whenever a value is assigned to a variable in the current shell execution environment, the export attribute shall be set for the variable. This applies to all forms of assignment, including those made as a side-effect of variable expansions or arithmetic expansions, and those made as a result of the operation of the cd, getopts, or read utilities.

            Note:
                As discussed in 2.9.1 Simple Commands, not all variable assignments happen in the current execution environment. When an assignment happens in a separate execution environment the export attribute is still set for the variable, but that does not affect the current execution environment.

*b
            This option shall be supported if the implementation supports the User Portability Utilities option. When job control and -b are both enabled, the shell shall write asynchronous notifications of background job completions (including termination by a signal), and may write asynchronous notifications of background job suspensions. See 2.11 Job Control for details. When job control is disabled, the -b option shall have no effect. Asynchronous notification shall not be enabled by default.
*C
            (Uppercase C.) Prevent existing regular files from being overwritten by the shell's '>' redirection operator (see 2.7.2 Redirecting Output); the ">|" redirection operator shall override this noclobber option for an individual file.
*e
            When this option is on, when any command fails (for any of the reasons listed in 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors or by returning an exit status greater than zero), the shell immediately shall exit, as if by executing the exit special built-in utility with no arguments, with the following exceptions:

                The failure of any individual command in a multi-command pipeline, or of any subshell environments in which command substitution was performed during word expansion, shall not cause the shell to exit. Only the failure of the pipeline itself shall be considered.
                The -e setting shall be ignored when executing the compound list following the while, until, if, or elif reserved word, a pipeline beginning with the ! reserved word, or any command of an AND-OR list other than the last.
                If the exit status of a compound command other than a subshell command was the result of a failure while -e was being ignored, then -e shall not apply to this command.

            This requirement applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately. For example, in:

            set -e; (false; echo one) | cat; echo two

            the false command causes the subshell to exit without executing echo one; however, echo two is executed because the exit status of the pipeline (false; echo one) | cat is zero.

            In

            set -e; echo $(false; echo one) two

            the false command causes the subshell in which the command substitution is performed to exit without executing echo one; the exit status of the subshell is ignored and the shell then executes the word-expanded command echo two.
*f
            The shell shall disable pathname expansion.
*h
            [OB] [Option Start] Setting this option may speed up PATH searches (see XBD 8. Environment Variables). This option may be enabled by default. [Option End]
*m
            This option shall be supported if the implementation supports the User Portability Utilities option. When this option is enabled, the shell shall perform job control actions as described in 2.11 Job Control. This option shall be enabled by default for interactive shells.
*n
            The shell shall read commands but does not execute them; this can be used to check for shell script syntax errors. Interactive shells and subshells of interactive shells, recursively, may ignore this option.
*o
            Write the current settings of the options to standard output in an unspecified format.
        +o
            Write the current option settings to standard output in a format that is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same options settings.
*o option

            Set various options, many of which shall be equivalent to the single option letters. The following values of option shall be supported:

            allexport
                Equivalent to -a.
            errexit
                Equivalent to -e.
            ignoreeof
                Prevent an interactive shell from exiting on end-of-file. This setting prevents accidental logouts when -D is entered. A user shall explicitly exit to leave the interactive shell. This option shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option.
            monitor
                Equivalent to -m. This option shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option.
            noclobber
                Equivalent to -C (uppercase C).
            noglob
                Equivalent to -f.
            noexec
                Equivalent to -n.
            nolog
                [OB] [Option Start] Prevent the entry of function definitions into the command history; see Command History List. This option may have no effect; it is kept for compatibility with previous versions of the standard. This option shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]
            notify
                Equivalent to -b.
            nounset
                Equivalent to -u.
            pipefail
                Derive the exit status of a pipeline from the exit statuses of all of the commands in the pipeline, not just the last (rightmost) command, as described in 2.9.2 Pipelines.
            verbose
                Equivalent to -v.
            vi
                Allow shell command line editing using the built-in vi editor. Enabling vi mode shall disable any other command line editing mode provided as an implementation extension. This option shall be supported if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option.

                It need not be possible to set vi mode on for certain block-mode terminals.
            xtrace
                Equivalent to -x.

*u
            When the shell tries to expand, in a parameter expansion or an arithmetic expansion, an unset parameter other than the '@' and '*' special parameters, it shall write a message to standard error and the expansion shall fail with the consequences specified in 2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors.
*v
            The shell shall write its input to standard error as it is read.
*x
            The shell shall write to standard error a trace for each command after it expands the command and before it executes it. It is unspecified whether the command that turns tracing off is traced.

        The default for all these options shall be off (unset) unless stated otherwise in the description of the option or unless the shell was invoked with them on; see sh.

        The remaining arguments shall be assigned in order to the positional parameters. The special parameter '#' shall be set to reflect the number of positional parameters. All positional parameters shall be unset before any new values are assigned.

        If the first argument is '-', the results are unspecified.

        The special argument "--" immediately following the set command name can be used to delimit the arguments if the first argument begins with '+' or '-', or to prevent inadvertent listing of all shell variables when there are no arguments. The command set -- without argument shall unset all positional parameters and set the special parameter '#' to zero.


## OPTIONS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

         0
            Successful completion.
        >0
            An invalid option was specified, or an error occurred.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        Application writers should avoid relying on set -e within functions. For example, in the following script:

        set -e
        start() {
            some_server
            echo some_server started successfully
        }
        start || echo >&2 some_server failed

        the -e setting is ignored within the function body (because the function is a command in an AND-OR list other than the last). Therefore, if some_server fails, the function carries on to echo "some_server started successfully", and the exit status of the function is zero (which means "some_server failed" is not output).

        Use of set -n causes the shell to parse the rest of the script without executing any commands, meaning that set +n cannot be used to undo the effect. Syntax checking is more commonly done via sh -n script_name.


## EXAMPLES

        Write out all variables and their values:

        set

        Set $1, $2, and $3 and set "$#" to 3:

        set c a b

        Turn on the -x and -v options:

        set -xv

        Unset all positional parameters:

        set --

        Set $1 to the value of x, even if it begins with '-' or '+':

        set -- "$x"

        Set the positional parameters to the expansion of x, even if x expands with a leading '-' or '+':

        set -- $x


## RATIONALE

        The set -- form is listed specifically in the SYNOPSIS even though this usage is implied by the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The explanation of this feature removes any ambiguity about whether the set -- form might be misinterpreted as being equivalent to set without any options or arguments. The functionality of this form has been adopted from the KornShell. In System V, set -- only unsets parameters if there is at least one argument; the only way to unset all parameters is to use shift. Using the KornShell version should not affect System V scripts because there should be no reason to issue it without arguments deliberately; if it were issued as, for example:

        set -- "$@"

        and there were in fact no arguments resulting from "$@", unsetting the parameters would have no result.

        The set + form in early proposals was omitted as being an unnecessary duplication of set alone and not widespread historical practice.

        The noclobber option was changed to allow set -C as well as the set -o noclobber option. The single-letter version was added so that the historical "$-" paradigm would not be broken; see 2.5.2 Special Parameters.

        The description of the -e option is intended to match the behavior of the 1988 version of the KornShell.

        The -h option is related to command name hashing. See hash. The normative description is deliberately vague because the way this option works varies between shell implementations.

        Earlier versions of this standard specified -h as a way to locate and remember utilities to be invoked by functions as those functions are defined (the utilities are normally located when the function is executed). However, this did not match existing practice in most shells.

        The following set options were omitted intentionally with the following rationale:

*k
            The -k option was originally added by the author of the Bourne shell to make it easier for users of pre-release versions of the shell. In early versions of the Bourne shell the construct set name=value had to be used to assign values to shell variables. The problem with -k is that the behavior affects parsing, virtually precluding writing any compilers. To explain the behavior of -k, it is necessary to describe the parsing algorithm, which is implementation-defined. For example:

            set -k; echo name=value

            and:

            set -k
            echo name=value

            behave differently. The interaction with functions is even more complex. What is more, the -k option is never needed, since the command line could have been reordered.
*t
            The -t option is hard to specify and almost never used. The only known use could be done with here-documents. Moreover, the behavior with ksh and sh differs. The reference page says that it exits after reading and executing one command. What is one command? If the input is date;date, sh executes both date commands while ksh does only the first.

        Consideration was given to rewriting set to simplify its confusing syntax. A specific suggestion was that the unset utility should be used to unset options instead of using the non-getopt()-able +option syntax. However, the conclusion was reached that the historical practice of using +option was satisfactory and that there was no compelling reason to modify such widespread historical practice.

        The -o option was adopted from the KornShell to address user needs. In addition to its generally friendly interface, -o is needed to provide the vi command line editing mode, for which historical practice yields no single-letter option name. (Although it might have been possible to invent such a letter, it was recognized that other editing modes would be developed and -o provides ample name space for describing such extensions.)

        Historical implementations are inconsistent in the format used for -o option status reporting. The +o format without an option-argument was added to allow portable access to the options that can be saved and then later restored using, for instance, a dot script.

        Historically, sh did trace the command set +x, but ksh did not.

        The ignoreeof setting prevents accidental logouts when the end-of-file character (typically -D) is entered. A user shall explicitly exit to leave the interactive shell.

        The set -m option was added to apply only to the UPE because it applies primarily to interactive use, not shell script applications.

        The ability to do asynchronous notification became available in the 1988 version of the KornShell. To have it occur, the user had to issue the command:

        trap "jobs -n" CLD

        The C shell provides two different levels of an asynchronous notification capability. The environment variable notify is analogous to what is done in set -b or set -o notify. When set, it notifies the user immediately of background job completions. When unset, this capability is turned off.

        The other notification ability comes through the built-in utility notify. The syntax is:

        notify [%job ... ]

        By issuing notify with no operands, it causes the C shell to notify the user asynchronously when the state of the current job changes. If given operands, notify asynchronously informs the user of changes in the states of the specified jobs.

        To add asynchronous notification to the POSIX shell, neither the KornShell extensions to trap, nor the C shell notify environment variable seemed appropriate (notify is not a proper POSIX environment variable name).

        The set -b option was selected as a compromise.

        The notify built-in was considered to have more functionality than was required for simple asynchronous notification.

        Historically, some shells applied the -u option to all parameters including $@ and $*. The standard developers felt that this was a misfeature since it is normal and common for $@ and $* to be used in shell scripts regardless of whether they were passed any arguments. Treating these uses as an error when no arguments are passed reduces the value of -u for its intended purpose of finding spelling mistakes in variable names and uses of unset positional parameters.


## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

        A future version of this standard may remove the -o nolog option.

## NAME

        trap — trap signals


## SYNOPSIS

        trap n [condition...]

##      
        trap -p [condition...]

##      
        trap [action condition...]


## DESCRIPTION

        If the -p option is not specified and the first operand is an unsigned decimal integer, the shell shall treat all operands as conditions, and shall reset each condition to the default value. Otherwise, if the -p option is not specified and there are operands, the first operand shall be treated as an action and the remaining as conditions.

        If action is '-', the shell shall reset each condition to the default value. If action is null (""), the shell shall ignore each specified condition if it arises. Otherwise, the argument action shall be read and executed by the shell when one of the corresponding conditions arises. The action of trap shall override a previous action (either default action or one explicitly set). The value of "$?" after the trap action completes shall be the value it had before the trap action was executed.

        The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, as listed in the tables of signal names in the  header defined in XBD 14. Headers; for example, HUP, INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations may permit names with the SIG prefix or ignore case in signal names as an extension. Setting a trap for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP produces undefined results.

        The EXIT condition shall occur when the shell terminates normally (exits), and may occur when the shell terminates abnormally as a result of delivery of a signal (other than SIGKILL) whose trap action is the default.

        The environment in which the shell executes a trap action on EXIT shall be identical to the environment immediately after the last command executed before the trap action on EXIT was executed.

        If action is neither '-' nor the empty string, then each time a matching condition arises, the action shall be executed in a manner equivalent to:

        eval action

        Signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell cannot be trapped or reset, although no error need be reported when attempting to do so. An interactive shell may reset or catch signals ignored on entry. Traps shall remain in place for a given shell until explicitly changed with another trap command.

        When a subshell is entered, traps that are not being ignored shall be set to the default actions, except in the case of a command substitution containing only a single trap command, when the traps need not be altered. Implementations may check for this case using only lexical analysis; for example, if `trap` and $( trap -- ) do not alter the traps in the subshell, cases such as assigning var=trap and then using $($var) may still alter them. This does not imply that the trap command cannot be used within the subshell to set new traps.

        The trap command with no operands shall write to standard output a list of commands associated with each of a set of conditions; if the -p option is not specified, this set shall contain only the conditions that are not in the default state (including signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell); if the -p option is specified, the set shall contain all conditions, except that it is unspecified whether conditions corresponding to the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals are included in the set. If the command is executed in a subshell, the implementation does not perform the optional check described above for a command substitution containing only a single trap command, and no trap commands with operands have been executed since entry to the subshell, the list shall contain the commands that were associated with each condition immediately before the subshell environment was entered. Otherwise, the list shall contain the commands currently associated with each condition. The format shall be:

        "trap -- %s %s ...\n", ,  ...

        The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same trapping results for the set of conditions included in the output, except for signals that were ignored on entry to the shell as described above. If this set includes conditions corresponding to the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals, the shell shall accept them when the output is reinput to the shell (where accepting them means they do not cause a non-zero exit status, a diagnostic message, or undefined behavior). For example:

        save_traps=$(trap -p)

        ...
        eval "$save_traps"

*r:

        save_traps=$(trap -p INT QUIT)
        trap "some command" INT QUIT

        ...

        eval "$save_traps"

        [XSI] [Option Start] XSI-conformant systems also allow numeric signal numbers for the conditions corresponding to the following signal names:

        1

##         SIGHUP
        2

##         SIGINT
        3

##         SIGQUIT
        6

##         SIGABRT
        9

##         SIGKILL
        14

##         SIGALRM
        15

##         SIGTERM

        [Option End]

        If an invalid signal name [XSI] [Option Start]  or number [Option End] is specified, the trap utility shall write a warning message to standard error.

        The trap special built-in shall conform to XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.


## OPTIONS

        The following option shall be supported:

*p
            Write to standard output a list of commands associated with each condition operand. The behavior when there are no operands is specified in the DESCRIPTION section.

            The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve the same trapping results for the specified set of conditions. If a condition operand is a condition corresponding to the SIGKILL or SIGSTOP signal, and trap -p without any operands would not include it in the set of conditions for which it writes output, the behavior is undefined if the output is reinput to the shell.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages and warning messages about invalid signal names [XSI] [Option Start]  or numbers. [Option End]


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

        If the trap name [XSI] [Option Start]  or number [Option End] is invalid, a non-zero exit status shall be returned; otherwise, zero shall be returned. For both interactive and non-interactive shells, invalid signal names [XSI] [Option Start]  or numbers [Option End] shall not be considered an error and shall not cause the shell to abort.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        When the -p option is not used, since trap with no operands does not output commands to restore traps that are currently set to default, these need to be restored separately. The RATIONALE section shows examples and describes their drawbacks.


## EXAMPLES

        Write out a list of all traps and actions:

        trap

        Set a trap so the logout utility in the directory referred to by the HOME environment variable executes when the shell terminates:

        trap '"$HOME"/logout' EXIT

*r:

        trap '"$HOME"/logout' 0

        Unset traps on INT, QUIT, TERM, and EXIT:

        trap - INT QUIT TERM EXIT


## RATIONALE

        Implementations may permit lowercase signal names as an extension. Implementations may also accept the names with the SIG prefix; no known historical shell does so. The trap and kill utilities in this volume of POSIX.1-2024 are now consistent in their omission of the SIG prefix for signal names. Some kill implementations do not allow the prefix, and kill -l lists the signals without prefixes.

        Trapping SIGKILL or SIGSTOP is syntactically accepted by some historical implementations, but it has no effect. Portable POSIX applications cannot attempt to trap these signals.

        The output format is not historical practice. Since the output of historical trap commands is not portable (because numeric signal values are not portable) and had to change to become so, an opportunity was taken to format the output in a way that a shell script could use to save and then later reuse a trap if it wanted.

        The KornShell uses an ERR trap that is triggered whenever set -e would cause an exit. This is allowable as an extension, but was not mandated, as other shells have not used it.

        The text about the environment for the EXIT trap invalidates the behavior of some historical versions of interactive shells which, for example, close the standard input before executing a trap on 0. For example, in some historical interactive shell sessions the following trap on 0 would always print "--":

        trap 'read foo; echo "-$foo-"' 0

        The command:

        trap 'eval " $cmd"' 0

        causes the contents of the shell variable cmd to be executed as a command when the shell exits. Using:

        trap '$cmd' 0

        does not work correctly if cmd contains any special characters such as quoting or redirections. Using:

        trap " $cmd" 0

        also works (the leading  character protects against unlikely cases where cmd is a decimal integer or begins with '-'), but it expands the cmd variable when the trap command is executed, not when the exit action is executed.

        The -p option was added because without it the method used to restore traps needs to include special handling of traps that are set to default when trap with no operands is used to save the current traps. One example is:

        save_traps=$(trap)
        trap "some command" INT QUIT
        save_traps="trap - INT QUIT; $save_traps"

        ...

        eval "$save_traps"

        but this method relies on hard-coding the commands to reset the traps that are being set. It also has a race condition if INT or QUIT was not set to default when saved, since it first sets them to default and then restores the saved traps. A more general approach would be:

        save_traps=$(trap)
        ...
        for sig in EXIT $( kill -l )
        do
            case "$sig" in
            SIGKILL | KILL | sigkill | kill | SIGSTOP | STOP | sigstop | stop)
            ;;
*) trap - $sig
            ;;
            esac
        done
        eval "$save_traps"

        This has the same race condition since it first sets all traps (that can be set) to default and then restores those that were not previously set to default.

        Historically, some shells behaved the same with and without -p when there are no operands. This standard requires that the set of conditions differs between the two cases: with -p it is all conditions (except possibly SIGKILL and SIGSTOP); without -p it is only the conditions that are not in the default state.

## NAME

        unset — unset values and attributes of variables and functions


## SYNOPSIS

        unset [-fv] name...


## DESCRIPTION

        The unset utility shall unset each variable or function definition specified by name that does not have the readonly attribute and remove any attributes other than readonly that have been given to name (see 2.15 Special Built-In Utilities export and readonly).

        If -v is specified, name refers to a variable name and the shell shall unset it and remove it from the environment. Read-only variables cannot be unset.

        If -f is specified, name refers to a function and the shell shall unset the function definition.

        If neither -f nor -v is specified, name refers to a variable; if a variable by that name does not exist, it is unspecified whether a function by that name, if any, shall be unset.

        Unsetting a variable or function that was not previously set shall not be considered an error and does not cause the shell to abort.

        The unset special built-in shall support XBD 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines.

        Note that:

        VARIABLE=

        is not equivalent to an unset of VARIABLE; in the example, VARIABLE is set to "". Also, the variables that can be unset should not be misinterpreted to include the special parameters (see 2.5.2 Special Parameters).


## OPTIONS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## OPERANDS

        See the DESCRIPTION.


## STDIN

        Not used.


## INPUT FILES

        None.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        None.


## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

        Default.


## STDOUT

        Not used.


## STDERR

        The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


## OUTPUT FILES

        None.


## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

        None.


## EXIT STATUS

         0
            All name operands were successfully unset.
        >0
            At least one name could not be unset.


## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

        Default.

The following sections are informative.

## APPLICATION USAGE

        None.


## EXAMPLES

        Unset VISUAL variable:

        unset -v VISUAL

        Unset the functions foo and bar:

        unset -f foo bar


## RATIONALE

        Consideration was given to omitting the -f option in favor of an unfunction utility, but the standard developers decided to retain historical practice.

        The -v option was introduced because System V historically used one name space for both variables and functions. When unset is used without options, System V historically unset either a function or a variable, and there was no confusion about which one was intended. A portable POSIX application can use unset without an option to unset a variable, but not a function; the -f option must be used.


## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

        None.
